Life demands constant change. Life is constant change. Tigers in the wild always have something to do, and itâ€™s usually life or death. In a zoo, they become bored, agitated, and develop health problems.\r\n\r\nImagine being that tiger. Youâ€™re trapped, you canâ€™t get out. Everything is so easy for you that you have nothing to do. Just wait around all day for something to happen. Maybe youâ€™ll get fed. Maybe itâ€™ll rain. Maybe that fat little bastard throwing rocks at you will fall over the railing. Youâ€™ve been sitting in that enclosure for so many years youâ€™ve forgotten how good it felt back in the jungles of Burma to creep up behind a person and rip his spine out, eight hundred pounds of man-eating killing machine. Then you remember, and you weep for your lost tiger-ness. Youâ€™re nothing but a pet now.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically speaking, weâ€™re all going to die someday and itâ€™s probably going to be quite painful. Hopefully it will be a surprise. Hopefully it will be quick. Fortunately, most of us are going to have to wait for it for awhile.\r\n\r\nWhat to do in the meantime? Many people forget themselves in the routine of work and family. They seem to be waiting for something interesting to happen. Their lives are relatively easy as they donâ€™t face the life or death challenges of the jungle, so they become passive. They become content just watching things.\r\n\r\nNot us. Not you. Weâ€™re not pets. We donâ€™t wait for things to happen. We make them happen.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why Bitch Kitty Racing is here. Itâ€™s time to have some fun.

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('36','body','Textile','As Bitch Kitty Racing has just finished it\'s first full quarter since we went online, it was time that we looked over our revenues. As John has earlier \"reported\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/news/bitch-kitty-revenue-report, the figures exceeded our best expectations and we easily met our goal of being able to purchase a six pack of beer in Mexico. \r\n\r\nI was curious as how we achieved such incredible success and decided to investigate just which fascinating ads were appearing on the web site. First let me backtrack a bit. _Getting_ these ads in the first place proved a bit more complicated than expected. To begin with, we swear. Not gratuitously, of course, but rather only when it is absolutely needed to effectively communicate artistic intent. Naturally, this had to go. Google does not approve of swearing, even artistically. \r\n\r\nAll offending words removed, we tried again. All that was left, as John put it, were \r\n\r\nbq. \"two canine terms, two mild oaths, one prostitute, one religious reference, and a donkey. Not so bad.\" \r\n\r\nBut it was. Still no love from Google. What is an aspiring online magazine such as *Bitch Kitty Racing* without Google ads? \r\n\r\nBut then it occurred to us:\r\n\r\nbq. \"Bitch.\" \r\n\r\nHmm. We were (and are) rather attached to the name, as John has earlier explained. In fact, we had actually changed the name at one point, only to realize that Bitch Kitty Racing was the One True Domain for us. Drastic action needed to be taken.\r\n\r\nJohn wrote an email. Surprisingly, Google was very cool about it. A quick response and we were in. \r\n\r\nEventually, the ads began and I noticed a few oddities. These oddities increased and finally yesterday I noticed these ads,  above one another.\r\n\r\n!<r:content part=\"bombs\" />!\r\n\r\nAfter noticing ads where I could either buy or sell a kidney (unfortunately did not make a screenshot of this and I realize that none of you believe me), I decided to look further into this. And this time, I made screenshots. \r\n\r\n!<r:content part=\"transplants\" />!\r\n\r\nApparently, Bitch Kitty Racing readers are a lot of old and infertile, bomb-sniffing, terminally ill gourmets who like to dine in Ireland. \r\n\r\n_Really._\r\n\r\nGoogle is justly famous for its brilliant mathematical algorithms that allow me to find that one little bit of info I need with little more than a simple query. I recently read that help wanted ads for Google (at least one famous billboard) are encrypted. You have to be smart enough to decrypt the billboard to even know that it\'s either an ad or for Google. When searching these days I can avoid mucking about with Boolean logic and such and simply write \"how to upload images in Ruby on Rails.\" I usually get what I want. Absolutely brilliant. \r\n\r\nWhere are these algorithms and the brilliant employees who wrote them now? Just how do \"Original American SWAT Boots\" relate to going to the wrong bathroom in a chic Northwest restaurant? How do pet tear stain removers relate to filling one\'s bathtub with jello? What _are_ pet tear stain removers? And most of all, how am I going to get rich and retire on the lovely Spanish island of Mallorca with such ads? \r\n\r\nThe answer is easy: money. People buy keywords without regard to the context. If a given combination of keywords shows up in the text, then that ad has to appear. And John has a, well, colorful choice of words. Stripped of his artistic ability to swear, he was forced to increase his vocabulary (already huge, thanks to those years in Art School) and the results can be seen below.\r\n\r\nI have provided here a small gallery for you with some of our choicest ads. I will let you make the connections to any articles presented here at Bitch Kitty Racing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','21');

The sexes have different communications styles, emotional responses, remembrance of pain, etc.  While no sweeping generality is scientifically sound, general trends can nonetheless be valid.  It would never be correct to say that: â€œAll men just want sex,\" or: â€œAll women just want babies,\" when the reproductive success of the species depends on procreation, yet current theory indicates trends in mating habits specific to the sexes.  For additional information on this subject, please see \"Dutch Treat and Mate Selection.\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/dutch-treat-and-mate-selection\r\n\r\nSo it is with couches and beds.  While neither sex will always have a specific piece of furniture of a specific quality, on several research outings our staff has noticed that women generally have better beds than do men, and that men generally have better couches than do women.  Better, of course, being a relative term, but here meaning more comfortable and suited to the purpose for which the object was created.  \r\n\r\nLet\'s start with the bed, shall we?  The bed purportedly has a single purpose: to forward sleep, yet everyone knows that a large majority of sex takes place in the bed, though one would assume that no one would buy a bed specifically for this purpose, or that Bitch Kitty Racing readers limit their sexual activities to the bedroom.  \r\n\r\nCertainly not.  That\'s why they invented the kitchen table.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that women\'s beds are superlatively comfortable places, resplendent in pillow tops, feather beds, extra pillows, linens selected on high thread count, and thick down comforters.  Men\'s beds tend to be more pragmatic, things like hard twin-sized mattresses with wool blankets, futons, piles of broken cinder blocks, floors, or perhaps the hallway by the front door. \r\n\r\n!/img/187.jpg!\r\n\r\nCouches show a reversal of the trend, which can easily be spotted while shopping for said pieces of furniture.  When men shop for a couch by themselves, they are invited to lie down on it to make sure it fits, the assumption being that there will be a lot of lying down taking place on the couch.  The salesperson knows that all important aspects of the male home life take place here: sports, beer, and sex.  The couch is not only the main place to watch _les 24 Heures du Mans_  on _le tÃ©lÃ©viseur_ while drinking _la biÃ¨re_, it is also the place where all men know that any chance of intercourse begins if she comes back to his place.  This is the make-out function of the couch, and we\'ll come back to it.\r\n\r\nWhen woman shops for a couch she is asked about her dÃ©cor and presented with a different set of options other than just size, like fabric and color.  She is selecting a couch on form, while the male of the species selects a couch on function.\r\n\r\nSo while the male of the species will walk out having purchased an eighteen-foot black leather sectional, both functional and masculine, the female will leave the store with something that can\'t properly be called a couch at all, like a loveseat, divan, or futon sofa (as an aside, it is interesting to note here that the myth of the male being more visually acute than the female is dispelled.  No one could possibly think an eighteen-foot black leather sectional looks good).\r\n\r\nThis is where the make-out angle comes into play and its derivative, the subconscious desire to reproduce, i.e. settle down, is brought into light.  \r\n\r\nThe male couch has excellent make-out functionality.  It\'s large, spacious, and can easily accommodate two in a variety of positions, assuming it isn\'t actually leather off which the occupants would comedically slide (tactilely, leather is also the second unsexiest material on the list of unsexy materials on which to place the naked, heated human skin; it\'s too sticky, and becomes slimy and cold when wet.  Vinyl is, of course, the worst).  All sorts of sexual activity can take place on the male couch, from foreplay to intercourse.\r\n\r\nHowever, the couch is not really designed for sleeping.  Once playtime is over, it\'s also closer to the door.  \r\n\r\nMaking out on her couch is a different experience all together.  The divan has no back so the occupants fall off.  The loveseat is too small to allow freedom of movement.  The futon sofa has a cant to it that crushes both occupants to the inside.  Making out properly is nearly impossible on these devices, so the lovers wind up on the floor in self defense.  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"188\" class=\"image\" />\r\n\r\nâ€œHey,\" she finally says.  â€œThis floor is really hard.  Why don\'t we hop into my superlatively comfortable bed?\"  There is a deeper intensity of feeling in the bedroom, of intimacy.  He knows that an invitation to the bedroom is very close to an invitation to spend the night.  Animally, it\'s like an invitation to nest, and the more comfortable the nest, the more likely the occupants will stay there.  \r\n\r\nOf course, this is only a general trend, yet it is in line with our ancient apelike bioanthropology.  The female of the species nested; the male of the species liked to visit nests.\r\n\r\nHowever, our sapient human behavior is different than out instinctual ape behavior, though perhaps just as subconsciously acted upon.  Let us remove what seem to be stereotypical generalities and reconsider the couch/bed tags.\r\n\r\nAn invitation to a comfortable bed is an invitation to sleep in it and, with regards to mating, an invitation to nest.  An invitation to a nice make-out couch is an invitation only to fuck.  \r\n\r\n!/img/133.jpg!\r\n\r\nBoth sexes may have nice couches and nice beds, or perhaps only one of each, or perhaps neither.  Yet the tags remain clear.  The eighteen foot black leather sectional brings to mind imagery of a person that likes stewies, Burt Bacharach, red meat, and Scotch.  The cosseting bed brings to mind imagery of Sundays spent in it reading the paper, falling asleep on a shoulder, cuddling, and children leaping on it in excitement for a trip to the zoo.  In this case, the couch sounds like a swinger and the bed sounds like a parent.  \r\n\r\nWinding up at your date\'s place is now a research outing, instead of winding up there because you\'re slutty.  Look at your own furniture before you go out.  By matching your date\'s make-out location preference to your own you stand a much better chance of finding an appropriate partner, whatever your preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','23');

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('43','body','Textile','The cat apparently ate something strange and suffered a bit of gastrointestinal disorder.  I have been waiting for this day for eleven years, ever since my tiny feline Christmas present began eating the box he came in.  I think it may have been a bit of strapping tape that finally got him, though, poor beast.  He had been working his way though a shipping container and must have ingested the acrylic adhesive that makes tape stick when he tore the container apart.  I remember something from Polymers 241 in college to the effect that acrylic adhesive administered topically or intramuscularly causes sarcomas in rats and mice, but I have no idea what sarcomas are; I was in the technology department, not biology.  Apparently, a sarcoma is a massive attack of vomiting, diarrhea, and dragging your furry little ass all over the Persian carpet I inherited from the back of a truck near my grandmother\'s house.  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/145/172.jpg!\r\n\r\nThe cat was sick for two days, weak and mewling, hardly able to disembowel his mealtime buffalo. Having lived with the devil for eleven years, I was sure it was just something he ate which, no matter how toxic, would pass through his system and be gone.  This cat has never been seriously ill a day in his life but, like all cats, barfs and shits by the boat load depending on how offended my guests will be with which smell.  \r\n\r\nHe was sick this time, though, and doing the horrible thing that cats do when it hurts to go to the bathroom: avoiding the litter box.  The little bastard has never before peed on a piece of furniture but, last night when I got home from honky tonkin\', unabashedly and gleefully wasted, there was a wet spot in the middle of the couch.  As I knew he wasn\'t feeling well, I just cleaned it up.  No big deal. \r\n\r\nThe Pasha, being a longhair, also needed a bit of cleaning himself south of the equator.  I soaked a wet rag and gave him a whore\'s bath down there, petting him and cooing to him.  He seemed very grateful to be rid of the smell.  When I awoke the next morning, he stank again, so again I soaked his hindquarters.  A proper bath would have to wait for me to get off work that evening.\r\n\r\nI related the story of my sick cat to my coworkers with a slight feeling of glee.  Eleven years of hair balls, scratches, and bites was leading to a feeling of justifiable vengeance satisfied.  \"He\'ll be right as rain as soon as he gets it all out\" I told whomever\'d listen, as most people really don\'t give a damn about another\'s pets or kids.  There were some doubts about his prognosis, however, and feelings that I may be wrong about the seriousness of his condition.\r\n\r\nDead wrong, at least according to my coworkers.  He obviously had seven different types of flesh-eating cancer and would die a slow and gruesome death which would cost me thousands and thousands of dollars.  One woman related the story of her cat having the same symptoms, and how he had to be put down: \"It was terrible!  Poor Kitty was so sick and the vet said the only humane thing to do was to murder my baby and then they pulled out a turkey baster and jabbed it in and out of her brain and there was blood everywhere and the cat screamed and cried and I screamed and cried and I was all covered with blood and guts and brains and I cried and cried for days and I\'ll never love another human being again because I\'m dead inside FOREVER!\"\r\n\r\nObviously, if I did not immediately take The Pasha to the kittycat emergency room I was the worst human being who ever lived, right in between Pol Pot and Idi Amin.  If I did not put down my Martini, stop flirting with the new hot cocktail waitress, and leave my bar right now I was, in fact, killing my beast through neglect and should never be allowed near any living being again.\r\n\r\nFine.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I was starting to worry a bit, but only because I didn\'t know if he\'d taste good if he died when he was this ill.  I keep an extra large stewpot around for the day that one of us finally succeeds in killing the other.  If I win, it\'s _Chat au Vin._  If he wins, I\'m sure I\'m _Homme Bourguignon,_ if he even bothers to cook me.  I imagine I\'ll just wake up one night to the sight of him thrashing around the bed, gulping my guts like an orca eating a seal.   \r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me at the front door like he always is, having heard my car blocks away.  As expected, he was completely recovered, just incredibly stinky.  If he had opposable thumbs I\'m sure he would have already given himself a nice soak in the tub, but claws and fangs only work on flesh.  It was bath time.\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/151/174.jpg!\r\n\r\nThough glad he was back to his old cantankerous self, I was a bit irritated at leaving both a drink and a cute brunette on a Friday night happy hour spree.  I went into the bedroom and took off my tie, searched around for fencing mask and leather gauntlets I wear on cat washing days.  The bed was incredibly mussed; I thought maybe I had forgotten to make it that morning.  I whipped back the sheets and there it was: the entire contents of my cat\'s bowels, along with length of strapping tape (I knew it!), in the middle of my bed.\r\n\r\nMy _new_ bed.  \r\n\r\nMy brand new silk-covered pillow-topped extra-luxury sleep system purchased at the expense of ever being able to retire, the only step I have ever taken in the direction of appearing civilized in the bedroom, with twelve pounds of liquid cat crap and three feet of plastic ribbon soaking into the middle of it.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered: there was a third item he\'d soiled over the years.  One of the seats out of my car.  I had pulled it out for racing (weight savings) and placed it in the living room.  He hopped right on it and curled up, fell asleep instantly.  My cat, right?  While I was away, the cat sitter said he never left that seat.  The minute I walked in the door two days later, he stood up in the seat and pissed all over it.  I tried to yank him off it, but he had his claws so far in I lifted both him and the seat.  This is a huge cat, mind you, a twenty-two pound Maine Coon, pissing while being swung around and around while hanging onto a car seat.  The smell never went away, no matter how many times I washed and soaked the seat with enzymatic cat piss remover.  I had to sell the car (a bit of advice: always buy a convertible with the top up).\r\n\r\nBut the bed, the bed . .  .\r\n\r\nLittle bastard.\r\n\r\nI went into the bathroom and taped the overflow drain of the tub shut, filled it all the way the very top.  I picked out a soap I know he hates, got on my safety gear and herded him into the bathroom with a tennis racket, one of our favorite games, right up there with Who\'s Going to Bleed the Most. \r\n\r\n_Boing!  Boing!  Boing!_\r\n\r\n*SPLASH!*\r\n\r\nIt was up to his ears.  After a moment\'s surprise, he popped his meaty paws on the edge of the tub and took a swipe at me, severing a tendon in my wrist. \r\n\r\nThen the little fucker started swimming.  _Swimming._  Then he ate the soap I was washing him with.  He totally ruined all my cat-torturingly good fun. \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/157/175.jpg!\r\n\r\nSo then he was clean and smelled good, but I was unsatisfied.  I thought about drying him in the microwave, but he was too big to fit so I just chased him around with a hair dryer.  \r\n\r\nBut now, now comes satisfaction.  I\'ve just oiled up the clippers and set them to the lowest height.  Usually he just gets a trim.  Today, today he gets a Mohawk.  Piss on my antique couch, will you?  Ruin my car seat, huh?  Crap in the middle of my bed, yeah?\r\n\r\n_Here, kitty kitty!_\r\n','24');

I have lots of these opinions.  Up until yesterday, I certainly had an opinion on Chrysler\'s PT Cruiser.  \"Total mom car,\" was all I had to say about that.  I have never been able to get over the styling, that hot rod look that Chrysler loved in the 1990\'s.  I know it has an emotional appeal to the Boomer generation, but it\'s lost on me.  Yet, by the end of long day behind the wheel of a PT, I truly came to appreciate this car.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time to pick my ride for the week, in the name of fairness I knew I had to pick something I was sure I\'d hate.  It\'s impossible to have a believable opinion if one displays prejudices, and I have slammed the hell out of the Cruiser without ever having driven one.  It was now time to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nThere I stood in front of a brand stinking new 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser, Touring Edition.  I signed the papers giggling; it was just so ridiculous.  This thing was the antithesis of me, or so I thought.  I had completely forgotten that Tom Gale, then head of new product development at Chrysler, had a hand in this car.  Mr. Gale has proven repeatedly that he knows what he\'s doing, and his trust in young designer Bryan Nesbitt must have been founded.  \r\n\r\n!/img/141.jpg!\r\n\r\nI love that new car smell and was not disappointed.  Outgassing vinyls and plastics overwhelmed my senses.  At first I thought I was just getting pleasantly high, but then I discerned that my eyes really were swimming.  There were the five distinct surface patterns in immediate view: rich glove-leather patterned vinyl right next to a smoother leather pattern, faux carbon fiber, two colors of shiny plastic, and a softly fuzzed headliner.  There were eight different shades of gray visible, a dash inset that carried the car\'s blue exterior color to the interior, chrome accents, and two blacks.  This is one visually busy car.  Further inspection shows further color and texture differences.  It\'s maddening at first, but just like TV you get used to all the flashing noise.  I did want to extend the exterior color into the door insets, though.  It\'d brighten up the interior and help to unify the car.\r\n\r\n!/img/142.jpg!\r\n\r\nAfter wresting my attention from the dash, I was finally able to look through the windshield only to discover that the upper left field of my vision was obscured by the roof (when first in line at stoplights, I had to bend down to see them).  I am not a tall person, only 5\'10,\" so I figured the seating position was set too high.  Rooting around under the seat showed that there was no adjustment.  I had the option of forward or backward, or could adjust the rake.  I made myself as comfortable as possible and began adjusting the steering wheel.  There was a tilt, but no telescope.  I also noticed that the wheel is huge, much larger in circumference that it needs to be because power-assisted steering is installed on this car.  It\'s silly, and it feels like something from the 1940\'s. \r\n\r\nEnough of my ranting.  \r\n\r\nThe Cruiser is a machine, a tool, and therefore must be judged on its ability to perform its assigned task.  Driving away from the lot, I was impressed with its pep; it really has a nice torque curve.  I was a little less impressed with the engine noise, however.  This car has a wonderfully growly tone of voice that would be incredibly appealing in any sports car, and perhaps that\'s the point, but seems a bit excessive in a station wagon.  It\'s really loud!  When I got to my destination I popped the hood and spied plastic intake runners; they might be to blame.  It\'s a pretty neat trick though, using plastic instead of metal.  It saves both weight and cost, and I\'m impressed.  Poking around more showed many thoughts in this direction, most notably a rubber bushing on the driveshaft to quell torque steer.  Again, a simple and cheap solution.  Chrysler really is trying to keep the cost down on this car.  I do wish they had provided scuff plates on the rear sills to match the ones in front, though.  Cost savings can only go so far before the car looks incomplete.\r\n\r\n!/img/140.jpg!\r\n\r\nI cracked the plastic wrapper on the manual and had a read about the 65/35 split removable rear seats, then opened the rear doors and took the seats out.   The 65 is heavy and hard to handle, but both sides came out with a minimum of fuss.  Once out, ye Gods!  The cargo space is seriously immense, looking capacious enough to swallow a Percheron whole.  The front passenger seat also folds down flat for even more area.  Right then and there the design engineering on this car won me over.  There is a lot of thought about the purpose and function of this car in it, and it shows.  This is the Tom Gale I respect so well, and I was able to let the styling go and give this car the respect it deserves.\r\n\r\nDriving the car in town I noticed some body roll, enough to make me feel the beginnings of nausea.  I had to alter my driving style and really smooth everything out before I became truly comfortable with the way it handled.  I attribute this to my own penchant for go-karts instead of cars, and the PT is a crossover vehicle, a station wagon _cum_ SUV _nee_ panel truck.  Driving it made me even more aware of its purpose and function, and keeping that in mind helped my control of the car.  \r\n\r\nI picked up my friend Michal and her dog, Piper, and we hit the road for a long day trip.  On the freeway the PT was relaxed and composed, a very capable long-distance car.  The long wheelbase and soft suspension, while perhaps mildly irritating in the city (but only mildly), proved to be a boon.  With the cruise control on, the car just loped down the road, keeping in its lane seemingly by itself.  The dog had plenty of room in the back, and the discovery of an auxiliary input in the stereo meant we could plug in the iPod with a cheap 1/8 to 1/8 cord, a very nice touch in this day and age.\r\n\r\n!/img/144.jpg!\r\n\r\nFreeways suck, however.  They lack all feeling, all emotion, all connection to the landscape or driving, so the moment we left the greater metropolitan area I hung a left into endless farmland and twisty roads.  \r\n\r\nThen the magic happened.  The car just totally came alive, completely in its element, cruising through the country with a big black lab, dog toys, picnic supplies, good friends, music up, windows down, and endless scenery.  Michal is prone to car sickness but never complained once, no matter how hard I pushed it.  The PT found all the natural lines in the corners without a single complaint.  While the wheel requires a lot of input, it\'s still a very smooth drive.  While I would never call this car challenging, I would call it fun.\r\n\r\n!/img/143.jpg!\r\n\r\nI would also call it lacking in top-end horsepower (there is a turbo version available which addresses this).  On such a beautiful day, I really only felt the need to pass somebody once.  I put my foot in it to achieve a suitable passing speed, but I could not get enough out of the car to feel comfortable overtaking a slower vehicle.  At lower speeds the PT feels peppy, but at higher speeds it\'s simply pepped out.  \r\n\r\nHigh horsepower is not what this car\'s about, however.  It\'s a people mover, a cargo hauler, and a real cruiser.  This car wants to work for a living, and working vehicles do what they\'re designed to do.  The PT is designed for a family day at the beach with the dog, or perhaps as a small work truck for in-city deliveries.  It can be a soccer taxi, a bread van, or a tailgater\'s delight.  There is a lot of car in this seemingly small package, and it nails its purpose.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of 180 miles of city, freeway, and country driving I still felt relaxed and comfortable.  The dog slept as the sun went down, the music was a bit quieter, and we were all ready for dinner.  As I put the car away for the night I gave it an affectionate pat and realized I was completely converted.  Everything about this car appeals to the vehicle design engineering geek in me.  I even have to admit that the exterior styling is pretty damned good.  It\'s unique, it stands out without being garish, and even after seven years it doesn\'t look dated.\r\n\r\nSo I stand a little wiser now and filled with crow, hopefully able to carry Mark Twain\'s valuable lesson with me into everyday life: \"We never knew an ignorant person yet but was prejudiced.\"\r\n\r\n!/img/146.jpg!\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sticker price with destination charge: $16,500<br/>\r\nBitch Kitty Racing value for dollar score (0-10, 10 best): 9<br/>\r\nEPA fuel economy (combined): 23<br/>\r\nBKR fuel economy: 19<br/>\r\nEPA air pollution score (0-10, 10 best): 6<br/>\r\nAnnual greenhouse gas emissions (tons): 8.0*<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chrysler is currently wondering what to do for their next generation PT.  Here are my suggestions: simplify and unify.  Tone down the interior and pay more attention to material selection.  Smoother and simpler surfaces would both make it look more modern and improve the experience.  The outside is relatively clean and simple; bring that ethos inside.  Match more interior surfaces to the outside paint color.  Look harder at the simplicity of the car\'s design inspiration, the 1940\'s, the sleek aircraft-inspired era before the jet age.  More windshield would be appreciated, starting a bit further forward with a longer rake, modernizing it while still carrying the theme through._\r\n\r\n_The cleaner and simpler the car looks, the more modern it will look, and also the more stylized, approaching Art Deco instead of Farm Truck Modern.  That would be really cool, and also play into Chrysler\'s design history and future._\r\n\r\n_More power please, and the addition of a cheap hybrid system like GM\'s would allow me to love this car even more.  Also, please do something about the engine noise.

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('47','body','Textile','I\'m getting used to the looks - the stares - the fingers pointed my way. I see the heads turning and I hear the whispers as people pass by.  There are gasps, \"oohs\" and \"ahs\" Inevitably, there is the person who just has to get a closer look, or the person who wants to see if what they have is better - or in some cases, faster.\r\n\r\nThe looks are for my car, my pride and joy. It is the 2006 Mustang in \"Legend Lime Green\" I purchased as somewhat of a parting gift at the end of a divorce. I never realized how much a car would let me feel like my old self again until I got this Mustang.\r\n\r\nI blame on my father in part for this Mustang obsession. When I was a kid, he bought a 1969 Mustang Mach I with a 351 under the hood. It had dark green paint and a black interior, with a dash full of gages just like a jet airplane. That big engine was so heavy, the rear end of the car would often let loose, making for a wild ride. That wild ride was a big thrill for me, especially by the time I reached driving age. My dad would unwisely let me borrow the car to drive to high school, and get to ballet rehearsals and classes. It was my introduction to power, speed, and a certain amount of reckless abandonment in a normally structured, stifling life.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"138\" class=\"image-left\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nI learned to drift the car early on, hitting the brakes just right so the back end would step out and slide around corners. At stop lights, I found just the right timing between brake and gas to get off the line first. I routinely left tire tracks going up the hill to school, and after class there were many races out along the old back roads.  A sense of oneness with the car\'s power and maneuverability was my advantage.  I had better control than nearly all the guys I raced, and they envied the Mustang\'s looks even after losing.\r\n\r\nSomehow, it never occurred to me that my father was rather suspicious of my reckless abandonment in his Mustang â€“ not even when the gas mileage went down to 9 mpg after I had been driving. Nor did it seem to surprise him when the guys I raced after school would challenge it later in the day only to find Dad behind the wheel. It wasn\'t until later in life that I discovered he took on a few of those challengers. I also discovered that he had gotten a warning from the State Patrol while â€œburning the carbon out of the engine\" on the freeway going to work one weekend. Then, much to my surprise, I caught him describing how he could make the Mach I drift to my 16-year-old daughter.  He told her that he knew I drifted it a few times, as well. Thanks Dad. \r\n\r\nFor someone relatively quiet and modest, the Mach I was anything but that. It was hard to imagine my dad or me racing around in that car, because it was the antithesis of how we appeared. But it brought out the kid in both of us â€“ the real spirit of adventure we had despite our very structured lives. I loved that car and cried when my dad sold it to someone else. He was afraid of what might happen if his 20-year-old daughter owned it. He tried to tell me it was an issue of maintenance, not recklessness, but I knew better.\r\n\r\nLater in life, I finally managed to buy my own Mustang â€“ a 1984 in charcoal grey with a sporty V-6. While the mid-80\'s weren\'t Ford\'s best effort on the Mustang, it was _my_ Mustang and I was proud of it. It was fun to drive.  I knew that car and how it felt. We made many road trips, including one to Mount St. Helens. I cruised up the back roads alongside the Toutle River, a cassette playing some rock music nice and loud. I cruised right up to the observation area and unwittingly past it, just rocking out in my Mustang, enjoying the view. When I realized I was the only vehicle to be found, it occurred to me I had passed the warning signs for the â€œred zone\" some time ago. It took no time to learn that my little Mustang could turn on a dime and then I hit the gas â€“ hard â€“with a lot of St. Helens ash billowing behind me. It would have made a great commercial. But the thought had not crossed my mind that if the mountain were to erupt, I was way too close for safe evacuation. So I hit the gas even harder and went speeding back down the road, past tree trunks stacked like toothpicks and a river redefined by a force of nature so great that it was inspiration enough to chance a ticket. My Mustang took corners in drift mode and at every straight I was doing over 100. I felt safe in my car and knew it would get me out of there alive. I believe the mountain had a brief burp of activity about two weeks later. Hell, I would have been to China by then at the rate I was going.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed working on the car; changing oil, installing nonstandard equipment, and even doing my own pinstriping. I\'d stop by my parents to show my dad the latest and we\'d poke around under the hood. Every so often, I would let him in on one of my adventures, far away from mom\'s hearing. We continued this even after I got married, but eventually it didn\'t happen as much. There was a certain amount of strain between the two men in my life, and my Mustang only mattered to one of them.\r\n\r\nAfter getting married and having a child, it was decided that my Mustang needed to be sold for a more practical family car, either a station wagon or a minivan. Trust me, if you\'ve driven a Mach I, you don\'t drive a station wagon or a minivan. I\'m a Mustang person and I like being fun, fast, and a bit unpredictable. I like the fact appearances can be deceiving. But my Mustang was traded fro the good of the family, and I faithfully drove a station wagon and hauled children, dogs, rabbits, and all sorts of home improvement supplies. The wagon went through a lot of wear and tear, and slowly it became more and more expensive to maintain. Finally, it was time to replace it.\r\n\r\nI remember being taken to the local Ford dealership by my then husband. He led me past the minivans and the SUV\'s to where the Mustangs were parked. I was thrilled; so many shiny new Mustangs, so many powerful engines, so much of that sense of abandonment I knew so well. I felt like a kid with a bunch of new toys just within reach. We came to a metallic cocoa colored one, with a striking light beige interior, and he told me to hop in in the driver\'s seat. He got in the passenger\'s side, easily fitting in the car â€“ unusual for his 6\'5\" frame. All I wanted was a test drive â€“ to feel the power and sense the handling again. I wanted to feel it drift even if it scared the crap out of the salesman. As I played with the various switches on the dash, my husband turned to me and said, â€œEnjoy it now, because this is as close as you\'re going to get to having one as long as I\'m alive.\" \r\n\r\nI was devastated. I felt like my sense of self had just been drained like oil out of the car. We ended up across the street at the Chevrolet dealership, his make of choice. I compromised with a bright red Cavalier Rally Sport with a 4-cylinder engine. Good dependable car that at least looked fast and was a couple thousand less than the Mustang. But it wasn\'t my Mustang and it still wasn\'t me.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and my husband\'s lucky streak held as I continued to allow him to breathe.  I finally moved on.  With the money I got from being bought out of the house after the divorce, I bought my Mustang â€“ in â€œLegend Lime Green.\" I still live in the same neighborhood so everyone gets to see me in my new hot car, including my ex. \r\n\r\nGetting the Mustang wasn\'t really revenge; it was part of my new independence. I researched the car, the cost, and the dealership. I chose the very basic of the Mustangs, not because of price, but because it looks like the classic Mustangs. It reminds me a lot of my dad\'s Mach I.  There are not a lot of extra knobs and lights and gadgets to get in the way of the neat interior. \r\n\r\nI walked into the dealer and said, â€œThis is what I want and this is what it should cost me.\" After a couple of hours of negotiating, I drove my new Mustang to my parents\' house and had my dad meet me in the driveway. He looked like a little kid at Christmas. The look wasn\'t just for the car, but for me as well.  He said I had this sparkle in my eyes he hadn\'t seen in years. He said, â€œIt\'s about time,\" which was exactly what he said to me when I told him I was getting a divorce. \r\n\r\nSitting on the coffee table of my apartment is all the paperwork for the annual Northwest Mustang Round-Up in July. It is filled out and my vacation request for a day off to do the road tour is approved. I plan to attend one of the judged shows with my car as well as some of the social events and the big barbeque. For the first time ever, I can enter this event with my own Mustang. And you can bet I\'m going to make sure my dad is there with me, too. I mean he is the reason I got into this Mustang thing in the first place. He\'s got to be there to take the credit for the car. Besides, we\'ve got some drifting to do.\r\n\r\nReckless abandonment is a wonderful feeling. I can make this car do a hairpin turn and I can glide down the open, unchecked freeway at speeds that would have made my other vehicles quiver. If I put my foot in the gas, the car goes â€“ fast. It also drifts, especially on those county back roads on a sunny day when I\'ve got the CD player loaded up with old rock music â€“ the good stuff. I lean the seat back and I relive those moments escaping the Mount St. Helens red zone as I slide around the corners and punch it down the straights. \r\n\r\nI feel free. \r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','26');

And as long as we\'re at it, the Tribeca looks like the offspring of a Pontiac Aztek and a Honda Civic.  Total barfer. \r\n\r\nWe here at Bitch Kitty Racing understand the need for corporate identity, and would like to congratulate Subaru for creating such an image for itself over the years.  Subaru is known for durable all-wheel drive cars with boxer engines.  Perhaps they\'re looking for a visual identity.  \r\n\r\nWe like the old grille very much.  We like the old emblem very much.  We like the somewhat inefficient boxer engine and all-wheel drive combination.  We hate the fuel economy.  If Subaru would clean up emission numbers and improve mileage across the range we\'d be ever so grateful, as its offerings are routinely pictured in idyllic outdoor enviroments spewing out unnecessary carbon dioxde.  Where is the hybrid?  Even GM beat Subaru on that one.  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"137\" form=\"image_and_caption\"/>\r\n\r\nSuabru does have a hybrid concept car that was seen in Detroit (sporting that god-awful grille), the B5-TPH.  It features lots of great technology and efficiency, but raises questions.  How much more will this drivetrain will this cost the average consumer?  When is it coming to the U.S.?  Aren\'t lithium-ion batteries awfully expensive?  Why is it a only two-seater when Subaru doesn\'t even sell those?  I know the hybrid system is slated for a test run on the Japanese market this Fall.  Why doesn\'t Subaru try it here in the States?\r\n\r\nSubaru is already famous for true sport utility vehicles, the quintessetial all-wheel drive wagon. While we hope their new SUV is selling well for them, we ask Subaru to please remember their true identity and get rid of the damned thing.  Not only is it design disaster, it ruins any chance you have of getting an enviromentally-friendly award from us.\r\n\r\nWe really love our Subies, but they need a SULEV rating (Super-Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) on all their cars as standard equipment, without additional cost, and available in every state.  They already sell cars that meet the SULEV requirements, and they are some of the cleanest in the world.  Why doesn\'t Subaru offer the option everywhere? It\'s a proper trade-off  for the engines and transmissions, and the poor fuel economy they cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also heartily congratulate Subaru on their Indiana plant, the first automotive manufacturing facility to have no waste enter a landfill.  Everything is reused or recycled.  Standing ovation from us!  Bravo!  Huzzah!\r\n\r\nWe really are fans, and we really are rooting for Subaru.

It seems you are trying to reinvent the brand by going back to its roots.  You seem to like to do this a lot with your brands, but this time, with the upcoming Enclave SUV, you are going head to head with Lexus.  It even looks like a Lexus.  \r\n\r\nThis is the sticky part, and I hope you\'ll forgive me for being blunt, but Buick\'s demographic is dying off.  I can\'t think of anyone in my generation who would drive a Buick, at least in its current guise.  You want me to pay Lexus money for an American car?  Why would I do that?  You lost me as a customer a long time ago.  Do you remember when emission standards were brought into play for your industry?  I believe that was over thirty-five years ago.  You, General Motors, told the lawmakers, \"It can\'t be done.  No engine can run that clean and still be affordable.\"  You flat out refused.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"131\" form=\"image_and_caption\"/>\r\n\r\nThen Honda handed you one of your own engines, a 350 if I remember this story correctly, that exceeded the emission standards.  Honda.  From Japan.  An engine that you manufactured that they tweaked.  And they royally kelked you all throughout the 70\'s and 80\'s, creating inexpensive cars that ran forever and sipped fuel while you built the Cadillac Fleetwood Royal Brougham.  I had one of those for two days, a 1976 model.  Four miles per gallon.  Four.  I literally gave that car away.  My next car was a 1976 Subaru station wagon that I bought with 135,000 miles on the clock because I trusted it.  It never failed me.\r\n\r\nTo your credit, you and the other Americans did figure sometime in the 1990\'s that your cars couldn\'t fall apart all the time, nor drive horribly, nor be overpriced, nor have the paint fall off, etc.  All those tiny Hondas running for three hundred thousand miles, all those Subarus lasting forever, all those sporting innovations from Mazda, then the influx of Japanese luxury brands, hopefully taught you a lesson.  Your cars are better engineered these days, even though a large portion of them are manufactured in Mexico and Canada.  So they can\'t really be called American.  Toyota, who has already crafted your coffin and is now withholding your food, builds American cars now.  \r\n\r\nHonda gave us the Insight, you gave us the Hummer.  Do you see where I\'m going with this?  It\'s like you\'re lost again, or living behind a wall built in the 1950\'s where American cars were king and the only brands available, because we had just nuked or firebombed the competition out of existence.  We need inexpensive dependability and you bring back Buick portholes.  \r\n\r\nPortholes?  You\'re getting your butt kicked and you bring back the Rocket Man, Harley Earl?  Do you have any idea what year this is?  We\'re already in space, Bob!\r\n\r\nIn your defense, I love your EcoTec engine, and can\'t wait to drive one (who developed that for you?  Was that Lotus Engineering?).  Your Pontiac Solstice is a beautiful little car, I can\'t wait until you get the bugs out of it (it also looks so much like my senior design project that you\'d better pray I never find one of my classmates working for you.  The resemblance is far too striking, as is the timing).  Beautiful is great, but cars are also supposed to be easy these days, and also drive well.  You\'ve built Audrey Hepburn in that car, and also its sister, the Saturn Sky, but it drives like Wallace Beery.  Â¡No bueno!  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image image_id=\"132\" form=\"image_and_caption\" />\r\n\r\nGetting back to Buick, it\'s time to pull the plug.  I have never seen anyone under the age of 70 driving one, and as I am a mid-thirties car guy out shopping for a new one, perhaps you might want to listen when I tell you I will never even look at a Buick.  Ever.  My grandfather drove one until Alzheimer\'s claimed his license.  That is my only Buick association.  Oh, that and an early 70\'s Apollo that blew its engine so hard we found a connecting rod in the oil pan.  \r\n\r\nNot to reopen wounds, but do you remember \"It\'s not your father\'s Oldsmobile?\"  Yeah, enough said.  \r\n\r\nKill Buick, open up a plant in the United States for a change (no more maquiladoras, please, you\'re killing American manufacturing with those, not to mention reinventing the sweatshop), and do something wonderful like you did with Saturn.  Oh, wait, you\'ve already got an established luxury brand in Cadillac, don\'t you?  Do you really need Buick?  Will anyone buy one? \r\n\r\nJust let it go.  It\'s time.  You\'ll be fine, I swear.  Spend your money (what little you have left) establishing yourself as an American manufacture of dependable cars, instead of this stupid luxury game.  Why not export one million Chevy Aveos (who\'s building those for you, by the way?  Oh, yeah, Korea) and get further in the burgeoning global market?\r\n\r\nPlease wake up to the situation that you, as the world\'s largest carmaker, have created.  Maybe it\'s time to move.  But kill Buick.  The name is a euphemism for vomiting, you know that, right?  Like hummer is a euphemism for fellatio.  Do you guys think about any of this?  No wonder Toyota is feeding on your liver while you\'re still alive.  \r\n\r\nKeep up with the wonderfully simple and cheap hybrids, the amazing EcoTec (what a beautiful motor!  Such a good idea!), and your killer Corvette.  Stop bringing up your past, which you really don\'t want to remind anyone of lest they actually remember, and keep going forward.  It\'s really what you do best. \r\n\r\nBest of luck!  \r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','29');

Yes, that\'s right, I said twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nDo you have a problem with that?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t think so.\r\n\r\nBirthdays always make me think of how old I am, as in: \"I can feel my cells degenerating.  I can\'t remember things like I used to.  Something hurts internally.\"   Many people say that age is just a number, and while I understand math and know that to be true, I also know that age does matter.  We change as we get older.  If age were just a number I would not be so sensitive to certain foods these days.  If age were just a number my coworkers wouldn\'t get wide-eyed and exclaim, \"You\'re how old?!\"  If age were just a number I wouldn\'t feel dirty when thinking about snack cakes.   \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/1/124.jpg!\r\n\r\n\"Snack cakes?\" you ask.  Allow me to elucidate.\r\n\r\nSnack cakes are the delicious little yummy treats we have in between meals, a.k.a. twenty-somethings.  I am _certainly_ not at an age where dating a twenty-two year old would be socially unacceptable, yet I know that we\'re very different.\r\n\r\nI was in the store this morning buying breakfast when I ran into a young female acquaintance of mine.  We chatted for awhile and I was admittedly transfixed by her smooth skin and glossy hair, generally vivacious and lively personality.  The conversation was coming to a close when she said, \"We should, like, totally get together sometime.\"  I\'m sure I stared at her for a moment before asking her if she knew that I was fourteen years her senior.   \"That doesn\'t matter,\" she replied.  \"Besides, you look great for being your age.\"\r\n\r\n_Really._\r\n\r\nWhile I did give her my number I am not sure if I\'m, like, totally going to get together with her sometime.  As I watched her tiny little youthful bum sashay away after our exchange, I noticed the way her hips moved: beautifully, gracefully, fluidly.  I wanted those hips.  I wanted those hips because mine hurt and I\'d like a transplant.  \r\n\r\nThe moment I realized I was viewing her as a possible donor of replacement parts was the moment I realized she might be too young for me.  At no point should you be looking at your date and thinking of her as an organ bank, yet I find myself staring at the skulls of young women far more than their bodies, wondering how much pituitary might be in there, wondering if they might share.  I have even written a poem about it:\r\n\r\nbq. Bye Baby Bunting<br/>\r\nDaddy\'s going hunting<br/>\r\nTo find some fresh young endocrine<br/>\r\nTo soak my aging organs in.<br/>\r\n\r\nOkay, so I didn\'t actually write the entire thing, but you get the idea.  \r\n\r\nOf course they\'re sexy at that age.  Our entire society is programmed to find young people sexy.  They\'re so taut and firm and full of life, so completely unjaded and hopeful.  My friend Sara has possibly the best line about trans-generational dating: \"It\'s okay to sleep with them, just don\'t make them fall in love with you.\"  She\'s one of several thirty-something female friends I have who\'ve dipped their toes into the pool of willing young men.  Actually, I think all of my single female friends have done some pretty serious bathing.  It\'s socially acceptable with women.  Sara would actually drool every time we\'d drive by a skate park, and we\'d laugh about it.  If I did that outside a Catholic school I\'d be lynched.  \r\n\r\nFor men, it\'s a bit different.  In polite society, we\'re not allowed to lust after women too many years younger than us.  Apparently it makes us perverted somehow, or shrinks our egos, or means we\'re unable to have a relationship with someone our own age.  There is a double standard which applies here.  Even though both young men and women might be easier to fall in bed with than someone older (fewer defenses, perhaps), older women can compare notes as easily as they compare shoes.  Young men are viewed as bits of virile, still-muscled arm candy.  They can take care of themselves.  Young women, however, need some sort of protection from the big bad wolf who might take advantage of their naivetÃ©.  \r\n\r\nI doubt very seriously that double standard sends the message of equality of the sexes.  \r\n\r\nStill, every modern man who wishes to keep his purity intact avoids younger women.  I\'m not talking about jailbait, either, because that is just dead wrong.  I\'m talking about the twenty-one year-olds that abound in every Friday night bar.  We know they\'re there, we can smell them, we can watch them move, but we don\'t dare approach them (to be honest, in this day and age we can\'t really approach anybody, but that\'s for Miss Manners to figure out, not me).  But what if they approach us?  What about my twenty-two year-old?  She\'s adorable!  \r\n\r\nThe date would begin in a bar where she\'d be carded and I wouldn\'t.  The cocktailer would look at me like I was scum.  She\'d rave about the band onstage, who I\'d never heard of, while I thought to myself that they sounded like Iggy Pop, who she\'d never heard of.  She\'d look embarrassed as hell introducing me to some of her friends that were there when they said, \"Nice to meet you, sir.\"  Undoubtedly some woman I\'d gone out with my own age would be there, laughing behind her hand, knowing full well that my lost virginity was older than my date.  One o\'clock would roll around and I\'d start to feel tired, wondering how I was going to fend off a trip to the speakeasy until five a.m. after I\'d already promised my date we\'d go.  I\'d be thinking of Sara\'s words all night long, wondering at what point it was okay to make out, wondering if the three date rule applied with someone who was seven when I got drunk onstage in Portland for my birthday that year.  \r\n\r\nComplicated.\r\n\r\nYet companionship knows no age limits.  It\'s possible to be friends with anyone.  It only takes remembering that everyone has different life experiences.  There are several famous romantic relationships between people with age disparity: Nick and Nora Charles, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, etc.  It\'s a matter of respect for the person you\'re with, regardless of age.  As long as that person is not treated like a toy, but like an actual human being, everything is going to go like it should.  That should apply to everyone anyway.  \r\n\r\nSo in addition to throwing away our outdated sexist cultural mores, let\'s throw away the outdated ageist ones, too.  We\'re all different, but we already knew that.  We all have our strengths and weaknesses.  Rather than different, let\'s call it \"new.\"  That\'s much more exciting, isn\'t it?\r\n\r\nShiny, shiny!\r\n','30');

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('59','body','Textile','\"Dutch Treat\" was originally an insult that implied that anyone who insisted on all parties paying their own way was cheap.  For the boomer generation, a college-age boy who insisted that a girl split the bill might not have gotten many second dates.  Furthermore, the boomers\' parents routinely viewed men who had women pay their way as gigolos.\r\n\r\n!/img/123.jpg!\r\n\r\nOne would assume that this prejudice stemmed from thousands of years of human culture in which men were stereotypically viewed as protectors and the hunters of sustenance, while women were viewed as gatherers and caretakers of home and family.  Popular American culture has certainly reinforced this stereotype, with the last century defining a woman\'s place as in the home raising children, except when the men were away during WWII.  After the war, women were expected to go back home, and a propaganda campaign was actually created to encourage this.  \r\n\r\nThe housewife image began breaking in the 1960\'s and 1970\'s, yet even today there is inequality in pay for equal jobs, which suggests that the stereotype still exists, at least in the eyes of male employers.  It would be wonderful to attribute this to the older generations, with their older mores, being in positions of peak power, but Gen-Y\'s use of the word \"bitch\" to connote both weakness and women would suggest otherwise.  \r\n\r\nIn modern thinking, rational adults expect men and women to be equal.  Let\'s create an illustrative couple named David and Elaine.  In Western culture of 2006, is it really respectful of David to presume that Elaine needs a big, strong man to take care of poor little her?  In the modern world, Elaine is just as much of a hunter as David.  She has to go to work every day just like he does.  She is expected to pay for her home just like he is.  She has to eat with or without him.  She buys her own clothes.  She has her own car.  She has her own financial advisor.  What, really, does she need him for?\r\n\r\nAssuming that the ancient biological function of dating is to find a mate, the only thing Elaine could possibly need David for is sperm, and it\'s highly unlikely in the modern world she even needs him for that.  Men being what they are, Elaine could go to any bar on a Friday night, choose an acceptable genetic donor and, after minimal pleasantries, probably have what it takes to make a baby.  She could also go to a fertility clinic and search through catalogues of men who have willingly given their entire personal and family histories for the specific purpose of a woman like Elaine being able to find what she wants in a child.  \r\n\r\nElaine has evolved past the monkey stage of evolution, however, though _homo erectus_ and all the way to modern _homo sapiens._  She probably does not view David as merely a potential sperm donor, but perhaps views him as a potential life partner.  If she were merely a monkey she would be instinctively looking for David to be a dominant male, strong and healthy, able to produce strong and healthy children that would survive into adulthood.   It is thought that the _homo erectus_ part of her wants David to be monogamous as well, for if he strays he will leave their nest and lower the chances of her offspring\'s survival.  \r\n\r\nThe fully human part of her still carries those desires as instincts, though her personal psychology will determine her choices.  The stereotypical attractive male is good-looking and masculine, traits which indicate a healthy body.  He should also be wealthy and powerful, traits which indicate dominance and the ability to provide.  He should also sensitive to his responsibilities regarding home and family, traits which will keep him close to the nest and less likely to leave Elaine.  All these traits are instincts designed for successful reproduction.  All of these instincts can be rationalized or ignored by Elaine because she\'s not a monkey.\r\n\r\nLorelei Lee says in the 1957 film _Gentlemen prefer Blondes_, \"Don\'t you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You wouldn\'t marry a girl just because she\'s pretty, but my goodness, doesn\'t it help?\"  Lorelei obviously knows that her instincts are not a rational reason for mate selection, yet concedes their influence.  \r\n\r\nBut what of David?  David has the same evolution as Lorelei and Elaine, and also has instinctual preferences.  David\'s modern instinct, though culturally moderated, is for women with ample breasts and hips.  David\'s monkey brain wants to successfully reproduce just as badly as Elaine\'s, so he seeks out a mate that will be able to bear a child and then feed it though infancy (it is said that men\'s attraction for full buttocks is a visual reminder of breast cleavage, though the current obsession with frottage might lead one to believe the other is true).  He seeks out pretty as a sign of health.  Pretty is often what is most regular in face and form, without defect.  For David\'s monkey forbears, pretty would have signified health, and health the increased success that his child will be born.\r\n\r\nModern men\'s pornographic magazines are filled with large breasted, ample-hipped, pretty young women.  In the ancient world, those women would have been most likely to attract mates, and in the modern world they apparently still are.  Even women seem to pick up on these signals, hence makeup, surgery and Botox to reduce the signs of age, breast augmentation, and the plentiful Stairmasters at gyms.\r\n\r\nDavid shares Elaine\'s instinctual preference for monogamy, though perhaps for a slightly different reason.  Elaine\'s female ancestors \"knew\" that a male than had sex with many other females would probably not stick around the hearth and help to rear the offspring, lowering the chance of their survival.  Such a male had a high likelihood of winding up protecting another of his children even over hers, lessening the chance that her DNA would be passed on.  David\'s male ancestors preferred a monogamous female because monogamy assures paternity, and David\'s selfish genes do not want to rear another\'s child.  They also want to be passed on.  \r\n\r\nLike Elaine, David is not a monkey either.  Though he is hard-wired to react to certain physical characteristics, it\'s the _erectus_  part of him and not the  _sapiens._  The sapient part of him is not going to marry a girl just because she\'s pretty, though he may date her for solely that reason and practice passing on his DNA.  However, being rational, David will select a mate based upon the same fundamental instinctual characteristic as Elaine: compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf David and Elaine are successfully dating, it\'s assumed they have the same ideas regarding home and family, and also their future together.  If Elaine were a 1906 kind of gal, David would bring home the bacon and she would fry it up in a pan.  In the year 2006, this is ludicrous.  Most families require two incomes to thrive these days.  Many families need two incomes merely to survive.  If the couple wants children, rearing them is a group effort.  Even single parents need additional help if they are to work, either in the form of family or daycare.  It takes more than one.\r\n\r\nThe child-rearing example previously illustrated also applies to the success of the couple to have the life that most people seem to favor, a life of security.  Many people want to have a home, money in saving, a retirement plan, vacations, perhaps a special car.  It is so much easier to afford these things when the cost is shared.  Indeed, in many major cities it is not possible for an average person to afford a house.  In Seattle for example, the median housing price is over $400,000, while the median income is only $55,000.  Simply put, in Seattle one median income does not buy a median home.  It takes two to own a home these days. \r\n\r\nYet there are still the outmoded bioanthropological and cultural instincts to overcome.  David and Elaine\'s culture is divided on the hot dating issue of who pays.  By assuming his historical responsibility of paying for dinner, David may be beating his monkey chest and showing to Elaine what a good provider he is, how he has wealth and the intelligence required to accumulate it.  Elaine may even instinctually react deep down to the big strong man, yet as stated she is perfectly capable of taking care of herself and is furthermore expected to do so when David\'s not around.  Many, if not most, modern women realize this and would see David\'s insistence on paying some sort of dominance game with which they will have no part.  It can actually be seen as offensive or the act of a \"male chauvinist pig.\" \r\n\r\nLet us assume that David and Elaine each make 50K annually.  Living in a city with its high cost of living, each can afford to spend one hundred dollars on a dinner.  Under the historical system, David chooses a restaurant that fits his budget and each gets an unspoken allowance of fifty bucks.  In the back of his mind, David may actually worry that Elaine is going to order the most expensive thing on the menu; he may be concerned that this dinner will cut into his ability to pay rent.  And goodness, what if they go out after?  How expensive it will be if Elaine wants to have _digetifs_ at the new hot club up the street!\r\n\r\nLook at the anthropological scenario this situation sets up: David is instinctually trying to show Elaine how well he can provide for her.  He is a strong hunter; he can kill many filet mignon to feed their potential offspring.  He is able gather a fine CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne to keep Elaine sustained while she guards the nest.  His mighty credit card shall ward off potential wolves that may carry off their children.  \r\n\r\nElaine has her own money.  She doesn\'t need David\'s.  Why should she have restrict her good time to David\'s budget?  If they each make 50K, and each can afford one hundred dollars for dinner, imagine how much nicer the dinner will be if they each spend the one hundred dollars they can afford.  Together they can go to the fancy new restaurant, the one neither could comfortably afford to treat the other to.  They can both relax and have a good time, order whatever they want, and sample all the offerings.  If the happy couple wants to go away for the weekend, imagine how much farther they could get if they shared expenses.  David or Elaine should be able to indicate what they can or cannot afford by simply making alternate suggestions for activities\r\n\r\n!/img/125.jpg!\r\n\r\nIf they continue dating they\'ll have to learn to work together and rely on each other financially anyway.  Historical roles do not work in today\'s world.  If David insists on paying for everything, he may up with a wife at home taking care of the children.  It\'s highly unlikely that she\'ll be satisfied as a person and the couple will never have all they deserve, either in possessions or happiness.  If Elaine insists on his paying for everything, she will find herself a mate that coddles her and treats her like a possession, like something he paid for. She will not be treated with the fullest respect that men reserve for equals.  Neither will she have all the nice things that a couple can afford, but an individual cannot.  \r\n\r\nIt\'s just splitting the bill, but the ramifications are so much more.  It\'s time to put our instincts behind us and use our rationale.  Our brains evolved so we could thrive.  Let\'s actually use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','32');

Its intent is to inform both sexes that normal life is possible for women living with HIV.  It does not cover men living with HIV, their lifestyles, sexuality, or risks.  It is not a primer on safe sex, nor is it intended to be.  The only HIV transmission that is discussed is from a responsible HIV-positive woman to a responsible HIV-negative man.\r\n\r\nThis article is informative entertainment only.  Information about safe sexual practice is widely available online.  Failure to practice safe sex is how HIV spreads.  Failure to practice safe sex greatly increases your risk of getting HIV.\r\n\r\nContact your local AIDS organization for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Women Living with HIV\r\n\r\nKelly Hill is usually described as \"elfin.\"   Not quite five feet tall, with lightly slanted, almond shaped eyes and a pixie haircut, her personality fills the room like Tinkerbell on an espresso jag.  On a Friday night, she\'s usually seen with a Cosmopolitan in one hand and cigarette in the other.  Kelly works for Babes Network, an organization that supports women living with HIV.  She brought along her coworker Nicole Price to the crowded Seattle bar to talk about the truth of living with HIV.  Though a very vivacious curly-headed blonde, Nicole seemingly has a tinge of melancholy at the edge of her personality.  She\'s paradoxically open yet reserved, flirty yet cool.  \r\n\r\nBoth women are HIV positive.\r\n\r\nLife with HIV is still life.  As Nicole says, \"I have HIV; I am not HIV.\"  Neither allows herself to be defined by the virus she carries in undetectable levels, the virus which hides in the brain and spinal column.  They both earn their living sharing their stories, giving other women the strength of positive example.  Through modern medication, and hopefully its descendents, both Kelly and Nicole can expect to live a normal lifespan.  Through temperament, both women can expect to lead normal lives.  However, they describe themselves as exceptions to the rule.  \"We\'re like this, but a lot of our women are not.  They\'re very different,\" says Kelly.  The women of whom she speaks may not have had enough education to understand their situation.  They may think their lives are over, become depressed and isolate themselves.  They may have had very traumatic experiences with others upon \"coming out,\" letting others know they are positive.  Not everyone is going to understand, accept, and offer support, not even in this day and age.  There is a social stigma attached to HIV, and that stigma lies in ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Education is key,\" Kelly says.  These women need to know that life goes on.  These women need to know that the things that made them feel good about themselves are still inside them, that they are the same people they were before.  There has been a change, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nNicole found out was HIV positive when her ex-boyfriend became very ill.  Though he was six foot three, his weight was down to 130 pounds.  He was constantly fatigued and had dizzy spells, but unfortunately had no health insurance.  He continued on with his life without knowing what was wrong with him, unable to afford the care he needed.  Finally hospitalized, tests revealed that he had two types of AIDS-related pneumonia: Cryptococcus and Kaposi sarcoma.  He had full-blown AIDS, and had probably been infected for ten years without knowing it.  \r\n\r\nNicole was tested and had to wait for two weeks for the results.  Unfortunately, her ex-boyfriend didn\'t want her to tell anyone why he was so sick.  She acquiesced, and had to wait for two weeks with only the support of one trusted confidante.  \"I had to tell somebody,\" she says.  \"I just couldn\'t keep something like that in.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the two weeks, Nicole was invited top sit down in a doctor\'s office at the hospital.  She found herself unable to enter the room, instead gripping the door while her friend waited nearby in the hall.  The doctor kept insisting that she enter the office and sit down, but Nicole kept refusing, instead demanding her results.  The doctor finally said, \"Well, let\'s just sit down.  Let\'s just talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Nicole.  \"I don\'t want to talk.  Here\'s my paper.  Tell me what the deal is.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor said, \"Okay, you\'ve tested positive for an HIV antibody.\"\r\n\r\nNicole still had her hand on the door.  She nodded to her friend in the hall, then slid to the floor.  She didn\'t even talk to the doctor after his pronouncement, she merely accepted his information packet and left.  \r\n\r\nOddly enough, Nicole believes she knows the time she became infected with the virus.  \"I\'m pretty sure I knew when I got it, because they say you develop flu-like symptoms when you are first infected and your body is trying to fight it off.\"  She had become very ill, was unable to even keep water down, and lay in bed for two weeks.  She finally saw a doctor, who pronounced she was dehydrated and needed more fluids.  The doctor would have had no way of knowing if indeed Nicole had become infected; the incubation period for the virus is too long.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after Nicole was diagnosed she attended a women\'s conference and heard stories of life with HIV.  There were women there who had been positive for a long time, and Nicole learned she could take medication to control the illness.  She also learned that not only would she live, but that she would be able to have a normal life.  After beginning her career at Babes she learned that she could still have children.  \r\n\r\nKelly Hill does have a child, a handsome, dark-eyed five year-old named Avram.  During pregnancy Kelly saw an HIV specialist and went on medication.  Her viral load was kept down to undetectable levels, and she gave birth to a normal, healthy, HIV-negative boy.  The transmission rate of HIV from mother to child is less than two percent, and in Washington State no child has been born with the virus since 1995.  Avram was tested for the first four months of his life, but after that even testing was unnecessary.  Like all mothers with HIV, Kelly was unable to breast feed.  Like all mothers with HIV, with minimal precautions Kelly poses no viral threat to her child.  \r\n\r\nA very important point must reiterated: current medications, properly taken, can suppress the virus to the point that a mother cannot even transmit the virus to a child _in utero,_ even though all bodily fluids are commingling.   This does not mean it\'s impossible, but it is worth noting.\r\n\r\nKelly\'s boyfriend at the time told her he had AIDS in April of 2000.  They had had unprotected sex, so Kelly assumed that she would test positive for the virus.  One month later, she did.  Retesting confirmed the result, but Kelly was still healthy.  She only began medication when she became pregnant a year later.  \r\n\r\nA year after giving birth to Avram, Kelly developed AIDS, a condition which is marked by a high viral load and a low CD4 cell count (CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection.  Their number signals the health of the immune system).  She began a new drug regimen, which quickly reversed her numbers.  She continues this regimen today, and will be on it for the rest if her life.\r\n\r\nKelly\'s ex-boyfriend and father of her child did not adhere to his regimen and the virus became resistant to his drugs.  He remains healthy, but his doctors are waiting to prescribe any other drugs because they want to be sure he will follow his program.  If he does not, the virus will mutate again and he will become resistant to his new drugs.  There is also the very real danger that the new virus, resistant to currently available drugs, will spread.  \r\n\r\nImagine being unexpectedly pressed to the floor by someone.  If that person releases the pressure, you can stand up and brace yourself against any further pressing.  The virus does this, and very efficiently.  It can mutate into entirely new strains.  There is now a fast-acting strain that is resistant to all current medications, commonly know as SuperAIDS.  The importance of taking the drugs when and as prescribed cannot be overstated.  There are only so many drugs available, and when none of these work the HIV-positive person will develop AIDS and become sick, then die prematurely.\r\n\r\nSexually speaking, the easiest transmission route of the virus is through a break in the skin, e.g. the vagina.  Women literally accept males inside them, and accept anything the male might be carrying in his semen, and HIV is carried in semen.  Kelly puts it rather succinctly: \"For a woman, you\'re a wide open receptacle.  Any kind of come or pre-come, any kind of anything comes into you, it\'s all shooting inside of you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is much harder for a man to get the virus from a woman.  As Nicole says, \"When a woman and a man are having sex it doesn\'t shoot inside of his penis, it goes around it, it\'s outside.\"  It is not impossible, but each partner has to have a break in the skin, those breaks must come into contact, and fluids must be exchanged.  The urethral opening is very small, and does not readily lend itself to this process.  In uncircumcised males, there may be cracks in the foreskin which allow transmission.  Herpes greatly increases the risk of HIV infection.  These are all examples of open sores or breaks in the skin.\r\n\r\nViral load plays a large role in transmission.  Remember that medication can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, even to the point that a mother cannot pass the virus on to the child while she is pregnant.  Responsible people with HIV get tested every three months to make sure the medication is still working.  They know their viral load and CD4 counts.  \r\n\r\nKelly and Nicole are both responsible women.  When they go out, they go out like anyone else.  They mingle, they flirt, they have fun.  Neither thinks that it is necessary to inform anyone with whom they are not going to have sexual contact that they are HIV-positive.  Both think that it is necessary to inform someone with whom they may have sexual contact that they are HIV-positive.  The topic does not come up in normal conversation, though both women are very open about their status.  \r\n\r\nIt also happens that in normal dating the women will find men who simply don\'t understand how the virus is transmitted.  Nicole tells of a man who reacted violently upon finding out she was HIV-positive, as if she were trying to trick him, as if she were some modern-day Typhoid Mary.  Kelly tells of a man who was not an ignorant jerk, who accepted the information in stride.  They both tell of men who simply wanted more information.  They both accept their potential partner\'s decision.  \r\n\r\nSafe sex can be had with an HIV-positive person.  In the case of a responsible HIV-positive woman and an HIV-negative man, IF the virus is suppressed to undetectable levels AND no breaks in the skin are present, normal sexual play is a highly unlikely transmission route,  _though not an impossible one._   Kissing will not do it. Petting will not do it.  Cunnilingus will not do it.  Fellatio will not do it.  Vaginal sex, using a condom, will not do it.  However, anal sex increases the risk of bleeding through tearing and should be avoided.  Any behavior which increases the risk of bleeding should be avoided, including severe biting or scratching.  Obviously, responsible adults will use communication and precautions to protect themselves further.  Obviously, responsible adults will use communication and precautions to protect themselves anyway.  \r\n\r\nKelly and Nicole are both normal women living normal lives.  They define themselves as who they are, not what they are.  This is one of life\'s most important lessons.  It doesn\'t matter if a person is rich, or is unattractive, or is missing a limb, or has a great car, or has a wonderful education, or has a virus.  None of these things define who the person is.  It is how the person views and lives life that is the definition of the person.  No matter what anyone possesses, life goes on, regardless.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','33');

Congratulations, you\'ve just made a date!  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/46/122.jpg!\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of meeting someone new (which often seems to be as much anxiety as arousal) we sometimes overlook the other person\'s intent toward us.  The other person is not misrepresenting his- or herself, he or she simply may have different relationship needs at the time of your meeting.  However, sometimes these needs are held too closely to be seen at first glance.  \r\n\r\nUsually, after a few dates, the truth is visible.  Conversation has revealed your date to have recently broken up with someone quite serious, and he or she is merely looking for someone to hang out with and hold hands at movies.  You, contrarily, are actually looking for someone with whom to settle down.  It doesn\'t mean that the two of you cannot establish a life-long friendship, or that a real relationship is not possible down the road, but at this time you are not compatible.  You are both good people and just trying to do the right thing for yourselves while being respectful to the other person.  \r\n\r\nSo what would have happened on Friday if you had winked at the person on your left instead of your right?  That person was equally charming and was also trying to catch your eye.  What if that person was looking to settle down as well?  What if now you\'ll never see that person again and that was \"the one?\"\r\n\r\nIt would be wonderful if we were able to see where a prospective date is in his or her relationship cycle.  It would be wonderful to know if the two of you have the correct relationship timing to date.  When things don\'t work out in a relationship it can be quite painful.  It would be wonderful to avoid that pain at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe Date Engineering Department here at Bitch Kitty Racing is here to help us all.  Our engineers have noticed that one\'s dating needs can often be correlated to the time after one\'s last serious relationship; e.g. a person freshly out of a marriage is probably not looking for a new wife.  Common wisdom indicates that it takes a person half the time of the previous relationship to get over it and be emotionally ready for someone new.  Our engineers have concluded that the Emotional Readiness to Date following a breakup can be represented by the following color badges:\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/19/red_bar.jpg!  \r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nRed: \"I am an emotional disaster area.  I\'m quite probably drunk and may break into tears at any moment.  I only left the house because my friends made me.\"  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/13/orange_bar.jpg!\r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nOrange: \"I am a danger to myself and others.  I\'m quite probably very drunk and may break into a tirade at any moment.  It is possible to attempt sex with me, but don\'t expect me to remember your name.\"\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/16/purple_bar.jpg!\r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nPurple: \"I am ready to attempt dating.  We can date more than once and have sex, but it will not work out.  Still, let\'s have some fun.\"\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/7/blue_bar.jpg!  \r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nBlue: \"I am ready for a rebound relationship.  Let\'s get romantic, but I can\'t promise you anything.\"\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/10/green_bar.jpg!\r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nGreen: \"I have had enough time to get over my past relationships.  I consider myself healed and am looking for someone to fall in love with.\"\r\n\r\nLet us assume that the following graph represents Mary.  Sadly enough, Mary and Jack broke up after dating for one year.  Mary\'s Emotional Readiness to Date factor is represented by the color bands through the graph, and the Time After Breakup is on listed on the bottom.  Let us assume that Mary does not date anyone else during the six months of her healing.  You can see, reading the graph from left to right, that as time passes, Mary heals and becomes more ready to date seriously again.  This is what our engineers call a Perfect Breakup Curve. \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/49/Perfect_Breakup_Curve_Version_2.jpg!  \r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\nJack, however, does not allow the full six months to pass before he begins dating again.  His is what the engineers call a \"Normal\" Breakup Curve, \"normal\" of course being a relative term but nonetheless representing one person\'s emotional state during the healing process.  Let us inspect Jack\'s graph, then interpret the events represented by the numbered points.\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/34/Normal_Breakup_Curve.jpg!  \r\n<hr class=\"clearleft\" />\r\n\r\n# Jack and Mary break up.  This begins his process of getting over Mary.  Let us call this the Mary Healing Curve.  It is easily visible as the overall trend of the curve to descend as it travels to the right.\r\n# Jack begins dating Elise.  Notice that Jack is still healing after his breakup with Mary, and his new infatuation cannot help him to heal faster.\r\n# Elise and Jack break up after dating for one month.  This shoots Jack\'s Emotional Readiness to Date factor back up into the red.\r\n# Given the short duration of his relationship with Elise, Jack recovers after two weeks (half the time of his relationship). However, he still cannot descend past the Mary Healing Curve.\r\n# Jack begins dating Portia.\r\n# After two months, Jack and Portia break up, once again sending Jack into the stratosphere of emotional unreadiness to date.\r\n# After one month, Jack is over Portia and again reaches the Mary Healing Curve.  However, at this point he is ready to seriously date someone again.\r\n\r\nAgain, this graph only represents Jack.  However, it does illustrate the healing process and how other relationships influence it: Jack cannot get over Mary any faster by dating new people.  In the case represented, dating seems harmless enough.  However, Jack could easily have girlfriend after girlfriend and remain in the orange if he doesn\'t allow enough time to pass between them.  While he will get over Mary eventually, he will nonetheless vary between an emotional nightmare and a danger to himself and others.  Our poor Jack will not be a happy guy.\r\n\r\nIt could also happen that Jack and Mary get back together for a brief period, then break up again.  Our engineers have not been able to speculate on such a graph, as chaos theory does not lend itself to visual interpretation.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Bitch Kitty Racing Dating Badge System, singles will be able to spot those who would be best for their dating needs.  As responsible adults, we neither want to inflict our emotional unreadiness on others nor have other\'s inflicted on ourselves.  Now we can all check the Perfect Breakup Curve against the time since the breakup of our last serious relationship and don the appropriately colored badge.  While out on the town, we search for others with the same color badge as us.  \r\n\r\nInstant dating gratification!  No more psychos!  No more missed opportunities!\r\n\r\nHuzzah! The dawn of a new age of mutual understanding is here!','34');

Keith is also an incredibly talented photographer, and I was excited to provide him with subject matter.  This would be a perfect opportunity to get him behind the lens.  I also had Shawn McCullough lined up to take pictures of the crowd.\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/88/96.jpg!\r\n\r\nMy friend and personal assistant, Corrine Bray, planned food, booze, clowns, fire dancers, music, and other assorted mayhem before we got into a fight over a woman and she stopped speaking to me except in monosyllabic sentences.  This made it a bit harder for me to really tack things down and get a schedule going.  Nonetheless, perseverance will always pay off so I forged ahead.  \r\n\r\nLuckily enough, the boys who run the studio space called the Bureau of Unspecified Services have very little sound judgment, common sense, or impulse control and agreed to all of the horrible and quite probably illegal activities that were to take place there.  They even agreed to remove the dead raccoon from the boiler room.  I love those guys, though in retrospect I\'m quite sure that making agreements with amoral and hedonistic Irish Mafia proves that I also have very little sound judgment, common sense, or impulse control.\r\n\r\nI planned out the menu, planned out the drinks, forecast probable sales and profit margins, created a time table, arranged entertainment, and generally overthought every conceivable eventuality that could take place that night.  I was undeniably, totally, and completely prepared.\r\n\r\nBy nine a.m. on the day of the shoot I knew I was undeniably, totally, and completely screwed.  Rather than sleep the night before I had gone out drinking with friends and then stayed the night with my new love.  There was no way in hell I was going to be able to get everyone and everything in place on schedule.  There was not going to be enough booze, we were going to run out of food, the lights were not going to show up, one of the photographers was going to die, some horrible accident or violent crime was going to take place, and the FBI was going to raid the place.\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/127/98.jpg!\r\n\r\nRunning around at top speed in a bright yellow supercharged car is a great way to get pulled over by the police, and I watched my schedule get further and further behind as the blue and red lights of the SPD flashed behind my car.  Nonetheless, I was determined to get all this done so I called Corrine and she somewhat less icily agreed to help.  We switched to her aged VW Rabbit, the one without any shock absorbers that rides like a prostitute roller coaster, and zoomed all over Seattle picking up materiel.  Somewhere in between Costco and Cash\'n\'Carry I threw up, but we finally got everything to the studio.\r\n\r\nLuckily enough, the aforementioned Bureau boys had gotten the beer.  I can only image the sight of two men in black suits and ties literally rolling kegs down the hill that is Pike Street.  Why the nice and seemingly sane brewery folks let them do this is beyond understanding, but I will always be sorry I missed the sight of fifteen gallons of aluminum-armored beer impacting a Toyota, and the ensuing arguments and bribes that must have taken place to avoid arrest for drunk, disorderly, negligent, and completely reckless behavior.  \r\n\r\nI went to the liquor store and finished incinerating any hope I have that my credit card company will not be calling me on a thrice-daily basis by purchasing enough vodka for three hundred cocktails.  In line, a bum who had obviously been urinating in his pants on a thrice-daily basis cut in front of everyone.  The clerk looked up at him, and apparently thought it would be easier to just check him out and get him out of the store.  Though no one with a heart will ever forgive me for this, at this point I snapped.  \"EXCUSE ME!\" I said, perhaps yelled at the bum.  \"The BACK of the LINE is THERE!\" thumb cocked behind me.\r\n\r\n\"What, you in some big hurry to get drunk, mother?!  You got somethin\' against black people?!  Cracker!\" was his slurry reply.\r\n\r\nThe two suburban fifty-something housewives in front me trembled.  \"Just let him go through,\" whispered one to me.  \"We don\'t want to get hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, lady. Give me a break.\"  Oddly enough, this didn\'t calm her down.  To the bum: \"Behind.  Me.\"\r\n\r\nIf I had been working the store, I would have asked me to leave, but my neighborhood is of such \"diversity\" that apparently my outburst was acceptable.  Though no one besides me was going to challenge him, the bum nonetheless shuffled to the back of the line without any comment.  Perhaps it was my obviously agitated and unshaven demeanor, or perhaps it was the thirty bottles of vodka I carried, but I think he knew he\'d met his match in the crazy department.    \r\n\r\nOn the two blocks back to the studio I was pulled over _again._  Looking at the police officer I had impure thoughts of her handcuffs and bullet-proof vest.  I suddenly wanted to leap out of the car so she\'d chase and tackle me.  While I reflected on how sexually exciting uniforms are it occurred to me: I had neglected to get a costume.  \r\n\r\nDamn it!\r\n\r\nI slowly, carefully drove back to the studio and traded the vodka for Corrine.  For some reason, and I admit this is both psychologically revealing and not always a good idea, whenever I panic I find a woman and let her take control of the situation.  This time I would up in the teenybopper version of a sex store trying on skin-tight patent-vinyl bodysuits.  At the counter, Corrine did something I have never seen a person do outside of a car lot: she haggled with the clerk.  \"Come on, this isn\'t really the price.  You guys always put this stuff on sale for half off a day after I buy it.  How much is it really?\"  Incredibly enough, Corrine won me fifty percent off my purchases.\r\n\r\nI ran back to the apartment, squeezed into this tight costume and tried to accessorize while jockeying for position with six people in various stages of dress, undress, and body paint.  But I did it, though with underwear outside of my pants and a leather harness  over my crotch I have no idea what the hell I was supposed to be.  \r\n\r\nFinally, at the studio, I could relax.  Everything was in place: bartender, door people, model release people, photographers.  My work was done.  Time for a delicious, relaxing, and refreshing Martini.  Thus began a set of alcohol-related decision making that can be best described as \"bad.\"  \r\n\r\nPersonality tests have shown me to be a systems person, meaning that I am able to create functioning operations out of people and materiel for specific purposes such as automobile production, or such things as this party.  The problem arises when the systems do not function because of the cogs I like to call \"people.\"  I simply do not understand other people\'s insistence that they have free will.  Simply do what I told you to do, the way I told you to do it, and I can avoid an aneurysm.  Alas, most people do not see their importance to the success of my machines, nor I am able to successfully communicate the reasoning behind this person\'s function in such a way that this person feels motivated and happy to do his part.  At best, my interpersonal motivational skills can be compared to a monkey trying to teach a house cat to read.  The cat has no idea why he would want to read, the monkey knows he doesn\'t speak cat, but yet insists on jumping up and down and yelling \"ook! ook! ook!\" at the cat anyway.  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/130/111.jpg!\r\n\r\nHalfway through the second Martini my phone rang.  \"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"John, where is this party?  I can\'t find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There\'s a map on the other side of your invitation.\"  Having worked as a professional mapmaker and draftsperson I had conveniently included a map complete with streets, building names and numbers, and also the names of the business that inhabited those buildings.  Furthermore, I had provided a diagram of the parking lot, a clearly labeled and highlighted location of the studio in relation to its surroundings, and a large bold font which said \"HERE\" with an arrow pointing to the front door.  \r\n\r\n\"I know, but it doesn\'t make any sense,\" said the caller.\r\n\r\nShe had to be joking.  \"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tenth and Pike.\"  \r\n\r\n\"You\'re here.  Walk South on Tenth, enter the parking lot, and it\'s on your left.  There\'s a sign and everything.\"  \r\n\r\n\"Okay.  Which way\'s South?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make sure the Mexican restaurant is on your left and the tavern is behind you, then walk.\"  The Martini was definitely improving my mood.  I love being tipsy.  It helps me not kill people.  \"Have you found the parking lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don\'t move.  I\'ll come out and get you.\"\r\n\r\nSo I went out and fetched the guests who were standing confusedly at the entrance to the parking lot and invited them warmly in, admired their costumes, and fed them booze.\r\n\r\nThe phone rang again.  \"Where is this place?  I can\'t find it.\"\r\n\r\nThis scenario repeated itself about fifteen more times.  By the time of the night I had expected things to be in full swing, there were fewer than twenty people standing guardedly around in the tight little non-interactive knots that characterize the Seattle social scene.  Ask any touring musician; Seattle audiences are the most unappreciative in the world.  They neither dance nor cheer.  This is why shoe-gazers abound here.  These morose little introspects already know that no one loves them, so they are perfectly happy on stage staring at the floor and plinking out the anthems of the perpetually misunderstood.  When no one claps at the end of the song, they are validated and feel superior.\r\n\r\nI herded what people I could in front of the camera, tried to pose them or least get them to do something entertaining, but there seemed to be some sort of antipathy building up between the photographers and models, and also between the photographers themselves.  I would assume that normally photographers know what they want and make the models do it.  Here, there was no interaction taking place.  There was no direction.  Everyone was just standing around waiting for something to happen.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, John?\" asked Keith, frustrated. \r\n\r\n\"For you to take pictures?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what?\"  Again, reluctant cog which results in system failure.  \"C\'mon, you\'re the art director,\" he sneered.  \r\n\r\nThough snotty, Keith was right.  Photographers shoot interesting things.  When there is nothing interesting going on, they don\'t shoot.  I was not paying these people.  They were here for the fun of it, but no one was having any.  I had to make interesting and fun things happen, yet I was also another failing cog.  Too little sleep combined with too much stress, then stirred lightly with vodka had left me with the imagination of a cotton ball.  I could not see what I wanted, yet motion was necessary.  \r\n\r\n\"Let\'s do this...\"  I bent and prodded the girls before the camera, tried to visualize the finished picture, posed and molded them, moved them slightly.  \"Uh...   Try this.  That\'s good, now do this.  Great.  Okay, now move this way.  Okay.\"  I still could not see what I wanted.  I could feel a certain enmity building within me for everyone and everything in the room.  I wanted to start punching people.  \"Kill each other,\" I said to the models.  They began to strangle each other and wrestle around.\r\n\r\nBingo.  \r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that looks nice.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, in retrospect I see what you, dear reader, have probably already seen by now: while I had the correct structure in place for the system to run well, I had not provided a reason why it should run at all.  No one had any idea what they were doing because no idea had been provided.  In fact, up until this point even I had been simply standing around and waiting for something to happen.  It doesn\'t work like that.  Nothing works like that.  Nothing will ever happen.\r\n\r\nSo I posed the girls, then posed myself, and staged a few fight scenes with other models for posterity.  Everyone seemed to know what they were doing and fun pictures were being taken. There.  My job was done.  Now I could relax.  And what better way than with yet another refreshing Martini? \r\n\r\n\"Hey, John, there\'s nothing really going on here so we\'re going to take off.\"\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/133/105.jpg!\r\n\r\nI looked up unhappily from my cocktail.  It was true.  This party sucked.  It was totally undercrowded and the entertainment hadn\'t shown up.  No clowns, no fire breathers, no jugglers.  Corrine suggested that she go to the club next door and round up some more people.  I agreed.\r\n\r\n\"John, can I talk to you?\" Keith.  In the kitchen, he related his dissatisfaction with having Shawn shoot the same subject at the same time.  Shawn, being a photographer, was doing the most natural thing in the world to him.  He was shooting the most interesting thing in the room, which was definitely not the crowd.  There was no crowd.  There were only people standing around and not doing anything, highly unscintillating subject matter, so he had been shooting right alongside Keith.\r\n\r\n\"I hate this, John,\" Keith said.  \"I\'m not taking any more pictures.  I\'m tired.  I\'m drunk.  I\'m going home.\"\r\n\r\nOh, no no no no...  I\'d known Keith a long time, almost my entire life.  I had seen this mood before.  This was not pretty.  This was not my friend Keith; this was Artist Keith.  This was the Incorrigible Obstinacy Keith.  \"Why don\'t you just ask Shawn to take turns?\" I suggested.  Obviously I was drunk to come up with such a zany solution, Keith said, but nonetheless, after some ego-smoothing and pep-talking, Keith reluctantly agreed, though I would have to handle the negotiations. \r\n\r\nAfter putting out that fire I walked back into the photo space where a man wearing fishnet stockings, garters, and not much else was on his hands and knees being flogged by a girl wearing liquid latex and not much else.  This was so far away from what I wanted I could actually feel blood dripping out of my ears.  This was just stupid.  Who in their right mind would really want to see this, and why?  I tried to form a sentence to Shawn who was happily shooting away, a sentence that indicated that this sort of activity was not what we were looking for, that this was adolescent drunken prurience at best, that re-enactments of pseudo-deviant sexuality just weren\'t very interesting.  I tried to form this sentence to be encouraging to his creativity, yet firm in my stance.\r\n\r\nWhat came out was: \"Stop.  Wasting.  Film.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked perplexed.  \"It\'s a digital camera.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don\'t.  Really.  Care.\"\r\n\r\nShawn is a big man, easily a size 50 jacket to my own slim 36, and I saw real anger flash in his eyes, yet I planted my feet and held my ground.  This aberrant behavior on my part in front of someone who has literally picked me up by the head before and bounced me off a wall must have made him nervous, because he waved the subjects off stage and began working on the next set.\r\n\r\nAt this point I snapped for the second time that day, but the Martinis kept me from berating the models that had just left the stage.  Instead I just picked up the flog and began beating one of them severely.  Soon my masochistic male subject was moaning in pleasure and I was finally starting to feel less angry, though it was frustrating to me that he enjoyed it.  Usually, when I feel like inflicting pain, I don\'t want the recipient to be so damned happy about it.  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/assets/136/107.jpg!\r\n\r\nAfter another Martini it seemed like good idea to accept an invitation into a private room to help a model get dressed.  While nothing even remotely sexual went on in that room (I was only lacing her corset) I nonetheless felt the shame of the inveterate philanderer when the first person I saw upon exiting was my new love, freshly arrived after a long night at work.  \r\n\r\n\"Oh, _really_,\" she said.  \r\n\r\n\"Hi, sweetie!\" I said and practically jumped into her lap, even though she was standing.  My first reaction upon seeing her was always to run around barking in tight little circles, leap into her arms and lick her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. You\'re loaded,\" she said.  \"_Great_.\"  \r\n\r\nWe\'d been dating for all of six weeks.\r\n\r\nI was saved from having to explain my seemingly questionable loyalty by the sudden return of Corrine with an entourage of what my generation calls batcavers, though they refer to themselves as goths.  The smell of clove cigarettes and Aqua Net brought a tear to my eye as I remembered the days of my youth.  Corrine had brought these kids from a nearby private dance club, and there was obviously a quite few other chemicals than just ethanol bobbing around in their bloodstreams.  Still, this was fresh meat for the camera, no matter how juked-up they were.  \r\n\r\nI knew more than a few of these people from my day job, at least in passing, though I hadn\'t really interacted with any of them before.  The world of industrial death rock had left me behind when it became passÃ© twenty years ago, and now that it was new again I was passÃ©.  However, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for too much black.  I love these kids.  I love their nasty little superior attitudes and tight sexy clothing, all that makeup and preparation in a city renowned for plaid flannel shirts.  These days they\'re mauling their faces with steel and tattoos, elongating their earlobes with ever larger weights and hoops, apparently finding the height of punk to be in the jungles of New Guinea, disfiguring themselves for life in the search for personal identity. They\'re just so cute!  \r\n\r\nAs if to illustrate my thoughts, a twenty-one year old girl I know, sporting a purple Mohawk (though she would reprimand me for calling it so.  \"It\'s a chicken hawk,\" she\'d say defensively) and a fresh brand, of course clad in black from head to toe, said to me, \"What\'re _you_ doing here?\"  Such adorable contemptuousness!\r\n\r\nThe models were, understandably, more akin to retarded hamsters than photo fodder, almost impossible to control or direct.  They were not the sexually libertine predators they imagined themselves to be.  They were, in fact, mostly hams.  Lots of bared teeth and saucy poses, portraying what they thought of as dangerous.  Still, we had the setup and we shot away, letting them do whatever they wanted until they warmed up and then pitting them against one other is a staged fight for the outcome of the globe.  Some of the pictures are entertaining, and some are just bloody awful.\r\n\r\nI finally gave in and just flowed with everything that was going on around me, no longer trying to control rapidly degenerating situation.  I wound up having fun searching for the ever more realistic fight scene, concentrating on which muscles should be flexed to look realistic, or what motion was necessary to impart the feeling of motion in a still image.  My new love proved to be an amazingly fun and willing subject in this search, allowing herself to be thrown around by an orange-dreaded woman who was easily six feet four.\r\n\r\nFinally, four a.m. rolled around and I declared myself legally dead.  I had consumed twice my body weight in vodka, impossible though this may seem, and been running on three hours of sleep for two days.  Keith and I packed up the gear and loaded it out into the waiting truck.  Goodbyes were said, though the party still continued.\r\n\r\nFinally in bed and curled up around the warm happy goodness that was my new love, I was able to let go of the stress I had created for myself with this experience.  Whatever the final outcome was to be, we had all created something that night and I believe that creation is, fundamentally, the point of life.  \r\n\r\nI kissed my beautiful girlfriend and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Epilog*\r\n\r\n_I stopped by the Bureau of Unspecified Services late the next day.  The boys were still up and still drinking.  Their feet were up on the kitchen table as all four of them leaned back in their chairs, black suits still immaculate, cigarettes still burning.  They had managed to consume the rest of the first keg and had a very good start on the next._\r\n\r\n_I walked into the main room to grab something, I forget what, and I was stilled by the sight. My jaw dropped, my breathing ceased. The destruction of the studio defies description, as futilely as trying to describe Angkor Wat using pictures from a disposable camera, but I find I must try anyway:_\r\n\r\n_Two thousand square feet of blood-colored floors and low-ceilinged white walls, the remains of thirty broken vodka bottles exploded from a concrete corner, blue, green and clear glass everywhere.  From the smashed limes, it\'s apparent that a game of cockshies had been taking place, then abandoned in alcoholic frustration, the remaining bottles and limes hurled with ever-increasing velocity at a moving, yet invisible target._\r\n\r\n_All the food that was left, all the food no one ate, was sprayed evenly on the floor like fake snow.  Tortilla chips, celery, carrots, bean dip, peanuts.  The words, \"OUT PIG DIE LUCKY\" were smeared on a wall in hummus, while ranch dressing spelled \"splorf\" on the bathroom door._\r\n\r\n_I hoped that wasn\'t blood leaking out from under the overturned couch, though a hand was clearly visible through countless empty beer cans, as if the hidden person had taken refuge during a spectacularly lethal game of smear the queer._  \r\n\r\n_The dead raccoon was back._\r\n\r\n_Termite mounds of cigarette butts still smoldered near every seating area, filling the air with a burning fiberglass smell.  The smokers themselves had obviously given up on the piles and started using the floor, then the seats.  There was the frame of an armchair, also still smoldering, covered with the contents of a disgorged fire extinguisher._\r\n\r\n_I backed out slowly, and with no words of farewell left the studio._\r\n\r\nPhoto Shoot: \"Costumes\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/galleries/costumes/','35');

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('67','body','Textile','The Yamhill Valley contains portions of the Oregon wine country, but those are the boring bits.  Too much traffic, too many Winnebagos.  The rest is softly undulating fields of wheat, hidden creeks, and oaks.  Up in the hills there are limitless two-lane roads that go nowhere, sticky tarmac that feels like rubber under the tires.  Then down into a hidden valley named after the original homesteader back in 1850, long since dead, barn still being pulled into the earth by blackberries.  There are stretches of road that follow the original section lines; one mile straight, ninety-degree turn, one mile straight.  There are roads that follow the creeks, wending their way towards the river and the final journey to the sea, roads never planned by an engineer\'s geometry but merely paved-over buggy trails that flow according to the natural rhythm of the ground.  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"47\" class=\"image\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nI learned to drive on these roads, propped up behind the wheel on my grandfather\'s lap, too short to touch the pedals but still able to steer the Dodge Adventurer pickup, Grandpa patiently avoiding death with the occasional correction.  I learned to love speed on these roads, riding with my uncle back from logging sites in yet another Dodge pickup, a Power Wagon he called Snort, the one with the too-tall tires and overdrive, never frightened because Uncle Denny could do anything well.  \r\n\r\nI learned danger driving with my grandmother in the Dart coupe.  She spent her entire life in this valley and knew every pebble, every glacial erratic from riding her horse through here when she was a little girl.  The white vinyl bench seat had to be set to its most forward position for the controls to be within her reach, and that immaculate machine leapt and rolled through the roads, not always within the lines but with unerring determination, gravel often clattering through the wheel wells.  \r\n\r\nDriving through here with my mother was always a different experience.  She knew everything about the physical world and why it worked.  Every stop brought forth a lesson on the Lake Missoula deluge, why stars fell from the sky, where fool\'s gold came from, what these fossils were, or perhaps just a chorus of Hit Parade songs from World War II.  She grew up here too, spending lots of time in the ditches with my grandfather\'s Mercury back in the early Sixties, too much speed and not enough control.  She has the distinction of being the first in the Valley to have seat belts installed, just like in the stock cars of the day; she claimed she slid around on the bench too much to keep it on the road.  Seat belts and a pair of glasses made her a legendary midnight drag racer.  \r\n\r\nI had my first car out here when I was ten; a safety orange, Briggs and Stratton powered, 3 ï¿½ horse fury.  Pop the clutch and a fan belt drove the right rear wheel, hand throttle jammed so far forward that I broke the detent.  My first road course was behind the local grammar school, special permission being given by the superintendent of the district, our next-door neighbor.  Lap after lap with instruction from my father about line and control, stopwatch ticking as I learned that sliding is slow and wrecking is even slower.  Here I learned that it is impossible to outrun the police no matter how fast you are, my first high-speed chase ending with me trembling in my grandmother\'s arms as she charmed the cop out of sending me to prison for life.\r\n\r\nI learned to love my first road car out here, the sound of a Ford 302 burbling happily enough through a glass-packed exhaust until you stomped it and became crushed into the broken bench seat.  I worked on that car every chance I got, constantly tuning it up, changing out yet another bit that age had claimed under the supervision of my mother who knew everything there is to know about cars.  Next came the Fiat, an Italian mechanical nightmare that broke down every Thursday without fail, but nonetheless loved the gravel and dirt logging roads that abound here in the fir forests on the way to the coast.  Then the Giugiaro-penned Alfa Romeo, a beautiful car that looked totally out of place here, something in its angular bodywork completely missing the point of the water-carved scenery.  \r\n\r\nHere I destroyed the Subaru station wagon that was to be handed over to my ex-wife as part of our divorce agreement, completely ripping off the exhaust system and breaking the struts as I found solace imagining I was an international rally star.  Here I brought both my first and second Miatas, both cars an expression of absolute unfettered joy.  With the top down I explored every possible driving option within a hundred mile radius, able to hear birdsong clearly while bombing along at eighty-five miles per hour.  Here I sat in the passenger seat of my new Mini while my uncle once again broke 100 on a straightaway, still unafraid because Uncle Denny can still do anything well.\r\n\r\nOn this most recent trip I found new roads, even though this is my home.  Sometimes you have to give up your eyes to see things that have been in front of you your entire life.  Coming west out of another small farming village I wound the Mini up through third, fourth and fifth gears, topping 120 miles per hour before braking for a ninety-degree turn, then winding it out again on the straight.  Over and over, accelerate, brake, turn, accelerate, just letting the car run free.  The Mini is a purposeful machine, no matter how bright yellow it is, no matter what it looks like.  It doesn\'t care about anything but the moment, where it is right now in relation to where it\'s going.  It never looks back.\r\n\r\nI had a stupidly happy childhood.  I\'m having a stupidly happy adulthood.  The wisdom of my grandparents became totally real at 120 miles per hour; I had a complete perspective change.  No matter if I chose to look through the windshield, the side windows, or the rear view mirror, the car moved ahead.  Through the front, what was to come; through the side, the odd stop-motion photography that speed imparts to vision; in the tiny rearview mirror, gently rolling fields filled with newly sprouted Spring wheat, and nothing else.  At that speed, it\'s far better to look ahead and control your motion instant by instant.  Staring backwards is a sure way to wreck.  I finally get that, now.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','36');

We chose a new upscale Italian place, so posh that there are no English versions of the menus.  This kind of pretension is rare in Seattle, but it does seem to be popping its ugly little weasel head up more and more.  Still, the food is very good, the waitstaff is one of the best looking in the city, and there is usually something interesting on the wine list.  \r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/28/99.jpg!\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I made my way down the hall to wash my hands.  The bathroom was unisex, as is apparently trendy these days as it makes for all sorts of mingling opportunities (\"So, uh, d\'ja make boom-boom or lemonade?\").  The barely frosted glass door with the letters \"WC\" etched on it showed a candle burning within.  How very Euro.  I opened the unlocked door, but the bathroom was occupied.  Indeed, the toilet itself was occupied.  A very attractive curly-haired brunette woman sat upon the apparatus with her elbows on her knees, unavoidably exposing her thighs and the slight spread of her bottom on the seat.  Though I did not dawdle or stare, I did notice she was quite pneumatic, very sexy.  Of course, she was also most probably ridding herself of a very crisp Pinot.  \"Oh! Excuse me,\" I said, and quickly shut the door.  I returned to my table so the young woman would not have to cause for further embarrassment upon encountering me as she emerged. \r\n\r\n\"You\'ll never believe it,\" I said at the table, \"But they don\'t seem to have locks on the bathroom doors.\"  \r\n\r\n\"I noticed that,\" said Emily (as an aside and note to our waitress, Emily was not my date.  Though you kept glaring at me like I was the kind of creep who dates nineteen year-olds, I assure you she was, in fact, twenty-four and was, in fact, not my date.  She was the roommate of a coworker and merely sitting next to me.  So save the disdainful facial expression for your father).  \"Was there anyone in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Was she hot?\" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Kind of,\" I said, too embarrassed to admit that I had looked at a women peeing and found her to be attractive, as if it was her urination that I found appealing.  \"I didn\'t really look.\"\r\n\r\n\"She come out yet?\" asked Peter.  \"Let me know when she does.  I want to see her.\"  My companions all began to squirm and turn in their seats, craning their necks to look over and around the high booth in which we sat.\r\n\r\n\"What\'d she look like?\" asked Aaron and Erin together.  It was then I realized that everyone at the table thought exactly as I felt; I had just seen a half-naked woman and it was kind of sexy.  Though accidental, and prurient, and slightly perverted, I had just seen a stranger with her pants off.  My friends were treating me as if I was the reason her pants were off, as if I had done something to deserve that glimpse of smoothly rounded thigh.  Were they all closet peeping Toms?  Did they masturbate while their dates piddled?  Or is the unlocked unisex bathroom the new grocery aisle?\r\n\r\nThe woman came out of the hall and blithely walked by our table, and she was, in fact, hot.  She saw me, smirked, and hid behind a curl as she walked by.  Was that a flirt?  I think that was a flirt.  Is a smirk a smile?  Is hiding behind a curl coyness?  I found it hard to believe she would recognize me from such a brief glance.  Maybe she just thought I was cute.\r\n\r\n\"Dude, she\'s hot.  You should talk to her,\" said Peter.  \r\n\r\n\"What the hell would I say to her, Pete? \"So, uh, did your pee smell funny?\'\"  But she was hot and she did smile at me.  Or did she?  She was behind my position at the table so I couldn\'t really scope her out, give her the eye, use the old Black Irish charm which has made it easy for the Irish to overpopulate any country with an adequate food supply.  I went back to the bathroom to wash my hands, putting a chair in front of the door so I could have a little privacy.  On the return to the table I could see her sitting at a large table with six other women and I could see that she was looking directly at me, no mistaking it.  I smiled at her and sat back down.\r\n\r\n\"Dude, she was totally checking you out,\" said Peter from his position facing her.  \r\n\r\n\"Doesn\'t matter.  I saw her pee.  I have never in my life wanted the kind of relationship where that level of intimacy is acceptable.  You know, like those couples who poop with the bathroom door open and continue their conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one does that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, they do.\"\r\n\r\nWe paid our bill and made our way to the door.  On they way out, Emily, by far the drunkest, began to make a bit of a spectacle of herself by having some sort of argument with Peter.  Her tiny little voice wound up and up through the register of human hearing, ending in the keening death wail of an angry rabbit.  Though the two of them were in front of us, they were obviously with us.  I began to feel a bit embarrassed.  As we passed the table of the seven women, my new friend was watching the scene.  \r\n\r\n\"We don\'t know them,\" I said to her, and flashed my most charming smile.\r\n\r\nThe brunette looked directly at me and slyly smiled.  \"Really.\"  She paused, then said loudly enough for her entire table, the table next to hers, the waitress who already thought I was a pedophile, and the entire foyer to hear, \"So, uh, tell me: did it make you hot to watch me pee?\"\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','38');

Masking tape haphazardly held down the flaps in a failing effort to keep the contents inside.  This was my soon-to-be ex-husband\'s handiwork, his reaction to my leaving after almost 20 years.  Pack me up.  Tape me up.  Send me away.  Trust me â€“ the idea of the new life ahead was liberating and I wanted to unpack.\r\n\r\n!/img/112.jpg!\r\n\r\nAwaiting the arrival of the box\'s contents was a new dresser complete with green velvet-lined drawers.  These were drawers you would expect to find in an upscale lingerie store, offering decadent treasures of all colors, shapes, sizes and textures, waiting to be filled.\r\n\r\nI ripped off the masking tape.  The flaps popped up like some jack-in-the-box toy.  All that was missing was the clown jumping out of the box, but then again my ex-husband sealed it closed from the outside.   I began pulling underwear from the box.  One-by-one the assortment of bras and panties amassed upon the floor.  To my horror, my eyes met with a sea of beige nylon that blended in with the apartment carpeting.  \r\n\r\nWhat the hell happened?  I used to have luscious lingerie that made me feel like I was ready at a moment\'s notice to act upon a sexual impulse.  I owned lingerie that was absolute tease to anyone who might even  peek at it.  Where did the black teddy go?  Where are the garters?  When did I become nothing but beige?\r\n\r\nI held up one panty, another beige brief  with a high waist and low-cut legs.  So practical.  It reminded me of my maternity underwear, the ones my ex-husband ridiculed:, \"Hey, I could park my truck in these.\"  There were quite a few of those briefs, reminders of how uncomfortable I was with how I looked, pregnant or not.  I pulled out another pair of panties; this time the elastic on the legs was actually falling off, the fabric so threadbare it looked lacy.  I recalled how so often I would hold onto things past their prime, because I might still be able to get some use out of them.   If struck by a car, I would have been so embarrassed by those panties. \r\n\r\nI pleaded with the box, \"Please tell me my bras exude more intrigue than my beige panties.\"  No such luck.  The bras were just as beige as the panties.  The theme of worn elastic was continued with one bra in particular,  its straps shortened up to compensate for elastic stretching out over the years.  I knew that bra well.  The straps repeatedly dropped off my shoulders, and not because of some moment of lustful teasing.  A woman versus strap struggle ensued usually at work in a moment of trying to look professional.  Digging through the pile, I pulled out one bra that lost its purpose long ago: a nursing bra.  I have no idea what it was doing in there, it just was there and it was beige.  The bra did provide a certain yardstick â€“ it was around seventeen years old.  I found another, a flimsy support number with little or no support except for the underwire.  The nylon held the general form of each breast, stretched out over time.  My bustline could not help but migrate south.\r\n\r\nI wanted to find the bras and panties worthy of my new dresser and its elegant drawers.  There should have been all sorts of colors and textures and shapes, like my capricious nature.  But all I found was undifferentiated beige.  Worse yet, under the day\'s outfit was more beige.  \r\n\r\nBeige â€“ that was for the woman who acted as a single parent for the majority of her marriage.  Beige â€“ that was for the woman whose husband told her, \"If you were one of my employees, I would have fired you by now.\"  Beige â€“ that was for the woman who went to bed each night dreading the required intimacy.  Beige â€“ it\'s not a color, it\'s an attitude. \r\n\r\nI hated looking at all that beige.  I hated being beige, invisible, undesirable, and complacent.  Maybe it took seventeen years to wind up this way, but I now I could change it faster than I unpacked it if I wanted.  Now was the opportunity to really set out on my new adventure as a single woman.  Forget blending in; I wanted people to know I\'m here and offering something.  I wanted people to know about all the wonderful colors and textures that make up Amy.  It doesn\'t have to be boastful, either, just not beige.\r\n\r\nYes, I bought all that beige underwear but now I was going to let it blend in somewhere else â€“ back in the jack-in-the-box carton.  I really wanted to put the clown back in it, too.  The only thing left now was to get the rest of the beige off of me.  I wanted to feel the teddy and the garters from years ago.  I wanted to feel my emerging self in a teddy and garters now. \r\n\r\nI left the new drawers empty and made my way to the lingerie department in the local mall, on an expedition for something new and exciting.  To my surprise, there were plenty of bras and panties that did not come in beige, but rather real colors such as red, black, blue, purple, and green.  So many lovely, frilly, adventurous bras and panties everywhere!  I must have spent an hour just looking at all the different options, all those different adventures.  Eventually, I picked something off the rack â€“ an all-lace bra in black with red satin ribbon trim that laced in front.  As I admired the piece, the bra fitter passed by and then stopped alongside me.  She looked at the bra, then at my bustline, and then at the bra again.  \r\n\r\n\"You\'ve got the wrong size\" she announced.  \r\n\r\n\"But it\'s the same size I\'ve had for years,\" I replied.  \r\n\r\n\"Then you\'ve had the wrong fit all those years.\"  \r\n\r\nShe could not summed up the last seventeen years any better.  \r\n\r\nWe went to a dressing room, where I stripped down to my beige bra.  Oh god, one of my worst fears realized:  exposing my beige bra in a lingerie department.  Over an hour and many combinations later, I emerged a in my new, true shape as a woman.  I had some pale yellow combinations that are silky with full lace cups on the bra and a lace insert in the panties.  There is the bright red lace combination, quite translucent, that made me look  like I\'m driving the Indy 500 on Valentine\'s Day.  There is the black silk combination with lace inserts that look like autumn leaves have softly touched down here and there.  Despite a fuller figure than I knew I had, no longer was I slouched over in a poorly fitting undergarment.  I looked at the new woman in the mirror, shoulders back, chin up, sensual bustline where it was supposed to be, not halfway to the South Pole.   As I stood looking at myself in yet another saucy combination, I told the bra fitter I wished to wear this out and to throw away the last of my beige underwear.  \r\n\r\nI liked the woman the mirror.  I liked her attitude.  Even dressed, all those wonderful colors and textures were still there to be seen.   This woman wouldn\'t apologize just to keep the peace.  She wouldn\'t explain herself.  She had no regrets.  She had no fear of the future.  \r\n\r\nThe black bra held me up as I paid for my purchases, then something caught my eye.  \"Excuse me,\" I said to the salesgirl in the beige skirt, \"Would you help me with those leather pants?\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','39');

I have begun sleeping eight or even ten hours a day; for someone who lives on five or six this is strange.  The housework is starting to pile up.  I have towels that I washed the day after Halloween sitting on my dining room table.  I have completely run out of coffee cups.  While the life of a bachelor is never a clean one, it can at least be organized.  I lost all my money in the detritus four days ago, checks, cash, and credit cards.  It\'s around here somewhere, but where?\r\n\r\nI feel completely jet-lagged.  \r\n\r\nWelcome to The Time Change.  We are now back on Pacific Standard Time here in Seattle.  That means it\'s light at nine and dark by five, and it\'s only November 15.  The average temperature is creeping down down down to forty degrees, the temperature inside your fridge.  \r\n\r\nI have decided that I might be showing signs of light and heat deficiency.  For someone of my lusty, swarthy nature this is some form of inhumane Nordic torture.  The Skandis may have invented the dark and brooding philosophy that defined the Twentieth Century, but my own people invented raping and pillaging Europe.  I realize that this magazine is technically a German company, but even my employers are a little dark-skinned, have noses a touch too large, have no foreskins.\r\n\r\nI digress. \r\n\r\nIn order to combat this accursed lack of light, heat, and order, I am going to clean the house while getting righteously drunk.\r\n\r\nFirst things first.  I turn on every daylight bulb in the house, those expensive long-lasting Norwegian ones (you\'ll never make a philosopher out of me, Norway, but thanks for the bulbs).  Twenty-two thousand Watts of faux sun begin to make me feel downright perky, even though my skin is starting to blacken and crack from the infrared.  Then I load the tranquilizer gun and prepare to hunt the cat.  \r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"109\" class=\"image\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nIf you have ever seen the fully grown bastard offspring of a cougar and a raccoon attack and eviscerate a bagless vacuum cleaner out of sheer irritation with the noise, you\'ll know that this ritual is one of kindness.  I\'m entirely serious about all that.  Less than a year into this animal\'s life I was unsuspectingly vacuuming the carpet when a banded Fury exploded in and hit the machine with enough force to rip it from my hands.  He wrapped himself around the still-running vacuum and bit into the handle, back claws jack-rabbiting the plastic dirt container into shards.  I spent the next three hours tweezing splinters out of a very upset cat.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing mayhem looks and sounds something like this:\r\n\r\n\"Here Kitty, Kitty!  Come here, Baby Kitty!  Come on, Pasha!\"\r\n\r\n_A dark and guttural howling springs forth form the bathroom, like seven timber wolves fighting over a human corpse._\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Mr. Puffy Pants!  Come get your medicine!\"\r\n\r\n_The metallic crashing of porcelain tiles off an iron tub as sharpening claws rake them from the wall._\r\n\r\nI know where he is.  I can distinctly hear broken ceramic clattering onto hardwood.  He\'s at the end of the tub closest the door.  Bad, very bad.  The hallway is only thirty inches wide, and its light switch is right across form the bathroom.  Damn!  He\'ll get me if I go for the light.\r\n\r\n_Silence._\r\n  \r\nHe tosses a chewed and broken human femur out the door, mocking me, taunting me, daring me.  It caroms off the wall opposite and clatters down the hall, landing at my feet.  I can hear the crunching of bones breaking under his immense weight as he shifts into position, coiling up, preparing to strike.\r\n\r\n_Silence._\r\n\r\nI know he can hear me, but I know he\'s a mostly a visual hunter.  Even though he has a brain the size of half a shelled walnut, he has a patience I will never own.  I wonder about his hearing, though.  I leave the hall and put on his favorite record, Sly and the Family Stone, turn it up loud.  \"Sing,\" \"Spin,\" or \"Sin\" comes on, I have never understood the lyrics to that song even though I find it quite catchy.  I wonder if he can hear me over the noise.  Apparently he can, because he flushes the toilet in reply, mocking me again.\r\n\r\nI flop down on my belly and try to crawl up the hall, preparing to ball up and cover my face and neck with my hands should he strike first.  The acute angle of the door\'s opening begins to obtuse with every tense elbow length forward.  I bring up the gun and turn on the night-vision scope, just in time to see him pounce.\r\n\r\nAll I can feel is the immense pressure of his jaws clamping down on my head, railroad spike teeth breaking skin and drilling bone, his fence-post claws pulling my shoulders nearer his maw.\r\n  \r\nOh, good, he\'s only playing!  If he were trying to kill me he\'d be severing my spine at the base of my neck with his jaws, using his back claws to dig through my soft underbelly and spray my life-giving guts all over the fine antique Persian rug.  I lift the rifle under him and fire into his groin, once, twice, three times.  The pain does not improve his mood, but at least gets him off me.  He screams at me, that grinder-on-metal sound of a junk car passing through a diesel-powered crusher.  He sways slightly, the drugs taking effect quickly.  I wonder if I missed and got him in the femoral artery.  Yup, there it, green tufted dart sticking out between belly and thigh.  His eyes narrow slightly as he quiets.  I sit up and watch him fall asleep, wiping the streaming blood off my face with a now-soaked shirtsleeve.  He begins to purr.\r\n\r\nI pull the dolly out of the closet and heave his bulk onto it, roll him into the bedroom and throw the iron bar into place over the door.  I should have thrown in a reindeer or two in case he wakes up, but there\'s already an unsuspecting band of lost hikers in there.  That should keep him happy.  I can hear them playing hackey sack now.  This will be interesting.\r\n\r\nOkay, now to the cupboard for the shaker and vodka.  Into the fridge for the ice and lemon.  I look at the mess and decide I have no idea where to start, so I sit back at the desk.  Suddenly an arrhythmic pounding starts from the back parts of the apartment.  I realize the dreadlocked white hikers have started a drum circle.  A wet popping sound stops the off-time thumping,  the sound of an irritated cat head-butting one musically impaired.  The screaming starts, the cries of, \"Dude, what was THAT? Oh my God, Dylan\'s dead!\"  Scrambling sounds, pounding at the bolted door.  Much more entertaining than cleaning.  I pour myself another drink.\r\n\r\nGood kitty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','40');

I will start with how to order, continue with how to tip in most situations, and finish with some basic bar etiquette.  By following this advice you will become a favorite of the bar staff, be treated with respect, and get free drinks.  You will get more drunk for less money.\r\n\r\nReady?\r\n\r\n!/img/110.jpg!\r\n\r\nh3. How to Order: The Commandments\r\n\r\n# *THE GOLDEN RULE:*  I am going to card you. Have it out and ready no matter what. Everything I own in this world depends on you HAVING PROOF OF AGE. I do not care how old you are. If I do not card you I will lose my job, my apartment, my car, my girlfriend, etc. The only people who object to being carded are VERY inexperienced young people, i.e. idiots. If you give me a hard time about ID, you WILL suffer for a very long time. I do not want to card you; I HAVE TO card you. \r\n# Get off the phone, and I mean NOW!  Otherwise you are going to get royally screwed, if I even talk to you.  I am going to short pour you, overcharge you, make fun of you, tell you to your face what a complete moron you are, etc.  You\'re not paying attention, and every person around me thinks my behavior is justified. \r\n# Know what you want before you talk to me.  Please.  I\'m slammed, and you\'re saying, \"Oh my God, Missy!  What do I want?  What\'re you having?  Oooh, look at that boy!  I don\'t know . . .  Give me a minute.\"  Screw you.  Get out of line, and let the poor thirtsy bastards behind you get a drink.  You are a stupid attention whore, and nothing but.  Get therapy, get Prozac, get bent.\r\n# Do not ever, and I mean EVER, ask me what my cheapest beer is!  What kind of a total moron are you?  You are saying: \"I\'m a cheap bastard!\"  Oh, yeah, you I want to deal with.  No tip for me, and with you buying three dollar pints, no money for the bar.  I really don\'t care if you order the cheapest thing on the menu, just don\'t advertise the fact that you suck so badly that you can\'t pay an extra dollar for the good stuff.  That\'s like walking into a grade school and announcing you are a sex offender.  What kind of attention do you want?\r\n# Be polite, but to the point.  Ready?  \"May I please have a Jack and Coke.\"  That\'s all I need to know.  Period.  If you say, \"Gimme a Jack and Coke,\" I\'m not going to like you.  Even if it\'s only subconscious, I\'m going to short pour you because I know in advance that you are a lousy tipper.  If I don\'t know you, please do not call me Chief, Dogg, Sport, Boss or Slick. It\'s very impolite, and all I\'m thinking is, \"Die.\"  Not a good way to get a good drink.  And do NOT small talk me, or ask me how I\'m doing (you don\'t care, and I\'m going to lie), or make demands for the local sports game without minimal pleasantries first.\r\n# Be friendly without being too familiar, or even very lightly flirt with a bartender of the opposite sex.  You have no idea how much impact a smiling, open face has on a bartender dealing with angry drunks all night.   We get treated disrespectfully by many customers and you were just charming.  Huge rewards for you.  For you nice folks I advise as politely as possible, and with respect, don\'t waste too much of my time.  I love you almost as much as money.  More importantly, I remember you.  I will try to treat you well in return.  You rock!  This is a VERY important rule, and combines will with:\r\n\r\nh3. How To Tip\r\n\r\nThe general rule in neighborhood Seattle bars is one dollar per drink.  This means if you order five Washington Apple shots for you and your friends you leave me five bucks.  It\'s great, the bartender makes lots of money this way, he will not skip you in line.  This is the adequate tip.  Get it? Adequate.  If you do this, your bartender will come to know and love you.  You will be treated well enough. \r\n\r\nWould you like better service?  What about a stiffer drink or even a free round now and again?  Tip more!  Sounds really easy, but it\'s true.  If you leave me two dollars per drink, I will get to know you much faster.  Think about it.  Five shots is ten dollars for me.  Or even just more than one dollar per drink, really.  The price difference to you is about one drink, but over time you will be more than amply rewarded in freebies, better and faster service.  In all seriousness, it\'s only a dollar.  That\'s a very small amount to pay for the bartender asking what you\'d like when you are clearly at the back of the line.\r\n\r\nWant to be treated like a rock star?  Tip fifty percent every time.  Or more.  Your tab is ten dollars for two drinks.  Leave a twenty.  You have no idea what an effect this has on my greedy little mind.  I will make every effort to remember you, and your drinks are going to be huge.  I will make every effort to get you as drunk as you want to be as cheaply as possible.  Those tiny little drinks everyone else has?  Not you, you are the person who pays my rent and bought me my car.  I will give you everything you want in mass quantities.  Your date will get specialized muddled drinks that I would never make for anyone else, with sixteen times the booze so your wallet gets away intact.\r\n\r\n*THIS IS IMPORTANT!  LET ME KNOW IF I CAN MAKE THIS CLEARER!*  Do you all see the pattern here?  The more you tip, the cheaper everything will get for you.  That poor fool at the end of the bar drinking five well gins at four bucks a pop is a sap.  You, on the other hand, will have five overpoured premium drinks and only pay for three or four.  His tab will be twenty dollars; his total with tip is twenty-five.  Your total will be sixteen dollars; you leave me thirty.  For five extra dollars you are having the night of your life while the sap complains about watered down drinks.\r\n\r\nOne major corollary here: do not EVER bring up how well you tip me.  This means you are an asshole and will be treated as such.  Only pretend gangsters (both pseudo-mafia and suburban thugs) bring this up.  Deal?  Okay.\r\n\r\nThe genral rule for free drinks is that you tip the purchase price of the drink.  You order a vodka soda which you know to be five dollars.  I say, \"I\'ve got this round,\" or it doesn\'t show up on your bill. You leave me five dollars tip on that drink.  Instead of paying six dollars for the drink with tip, you only paid five.  You just saved a dollar!  Get it?  Cheaper, every time.  You win, I win.\r\n\r\nDo not leave me coins, or tell me you\'ll get me next time.  These actions ensure that I am going to short pour your next drink, if I deign to pour it at all.  You are going to wait longer, no matter what.  Count on it.\r\n\r\nLastly, your winning smile and the boobs you flash are not a tip.  Flirting is not a tip.  A tip is money and only money.  Your cleavage does not pay my rent.  If you smile, flirt, show cleavage, and TIP WELL I will treat you like the goddess you are.  If you do the first three and neglect the fourth you are a slutty skank.  Expect to be treated as such.\r\n\r\nh3. How to Treat the Bar Staff\r\n\r\nSimple and easy. \r\n\r\nIf you are male, do not flirt with the cocktail waitress unless she flirts with you first.  She cannot tell you what an fat pig you are and expect to get tipped.  If you flirt with her and she doesn\'t like you (which is 99% of the time, no matter what you think you are) she can\'t go away.  She has to take it.  I really need all of you out there to understand that this is some wierd but legal form of sexual assault.  If you touch her or comment on her body it IS sexual assault.  The kind you can be expelled from the bar for, the kind you kind be severly beaten by the bouncers for, the kind you can be arrested for.  Be friendly and polite, but no more.  If she likes you and wants to meet you, she\'ll let you know.  You will have a much greater chance of talking to her by using this method than by telling her what a nice rack she has.  She\'ll think you\'re a nice guy.  You can prove otherwise later.\r\n\r\nDo not be a drunk.  You can be drunk, but keep it under control.  It is illegal for you to be disruptive or disorderly in a bar.  ILLEGAL.  I can lose my license to tend bar, the bar can lose its license to sell liquor.  If we tell you you are being too loud, shut the fuck up!  Please tell your brain to remember this the next time you are drunk.  Please!\r\n\r\nThe slightest bit of respect and understanding is all any bar staff requires. Is it busy?  Expect to wait, and know that if you\'re polite about the wait time it will be reduced next time, because we like you.  Say please, say thank you.  So nice to hear! \r\n\r\nDid I just mess up your drink?  Do not tell me what you ordered, tell me what the problem is.  Do not tell me, \"I ordered whiskey!\"  Say, \"Excuse me, I\'m sorry, but I think this is scotch but I thought I ordered bourbon.\"  The first approach will ensure that I hate you.  The second approach makes me want to buy you a drink to make things right for you.  Is there tonic in your drink instead of soda?  \"Excuse me, I\'m sorry, but I think this might be tonic instead of soda.\"  You are taking a do-not-want-to-offend stance with this line.  I will do what I can to make it better.\r\n\r\nDo you think your drink is weak?  Be polite, be respectful, and know that the bartender might not agree with you.  If you are of the opposite sex, fire up the semi-flirty charm!  If you smile and are charming, no matter your sex, I will try to be cool about your complaint.  If you are demanding, I will simply charge you for a double.\r\n\r\nThe bartender is always right.  This is his bar, no matter who owns it.  It is his responsibility.  It is his financial well-being.  If something goes wrong, it can be his financial ruin NO MATTER WHO OWNS THE BAR!  The bartender is legally responsible for every drunk idiot who comes in and leaves.  If one of his customers injures or kills someone, the bartender can be successfully sued and lose everything.  This really happens, folks.  This is actual case law.\r\n\r\nI am totally responsible for your drunk ass, and I hate you for it.  Will you please be polite and try to be respectful?  Not \"Sir,\" but simply \"please\" and \"thank you.\"  Wait when I\'m busy. \r\n\r\nWhen walking into any strange bar, please ask the bartender if there is table service.  If there is, go sit down and wait for the cocktailer.  He or she will make no money if you are ordering from the bar all night, and you will be ignored on any return visit.\r\n\r\nIf you camp, if you take up a seat in a bar for an extended period of time, if you sit for hours and hours (it is common to see people sit and drink for a bartender\'s entire shift!), over tip.  And I mean fatty fatty fat fat fat.  You are sitting on the server\'s rent check, taking up his or her ability to make tips off the people who could be sitting in that seat.  If you don\'t tip well in this situation, you will pay more and get less on any return visit.\r\n\r\nIf you are refused alcohol service the best thing to do is leave the bar.  Preferably quickly and quietly.  If things go spectacularly wrong and you are asked to leave, the best thing to do is leave the bar.  Preferably quickly and quietly.  If you have no idea why these inhuman monsters are treating you so unfairly and calling you names, the best thing to do is leave the bar.  Preferably quickly and quietly.  Failure to leave quickly and quietly can and eventually will involve physical expulsion or removal by the police.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you are being escorted or physically expelled out of the establishment by a member of the bar staff, the absolutely last thing you want to say is: \"If you touch me I\'ll kill you!\"  Many states have no battery laws, only assault, and the words \"I\'ll kill you!\" constitute a very serious threat (no one cares what words came before the threat).  This means that the staff member can physically defend him- or herself.  Hopefully your escort is of a good nature and will realize that you are just an idiot and not actually dangerous.  Hopefully he or she won\'t just rush you and push you towards the door as hard as possible, maybe causing you to impact things like tables, walls, railings, doors or windows.  That would hurt.\r\n\r\nh3. How to Act in a Bar\r\n\r\nRemember that you have been drinking.  You\'re paying money for the pleasure of being intoxicated.  You have an altered mind state.  You are not yourself.\r\n\r\nEverything you do is now compromised.  Every thought you have is a lie.  That person you\'re flirting with is not that cute.  You are not at all attractive.  The worst sin of all is that of unwanted attention.  You, being loaded, think that girl wants you to talk to her.  You\'re wrong.  She thinks you\'re an idiot.  YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS NO MATTER HOW DRUNK YOU ARE.\r\n\r\nDo not EVER attempt to flirt or try to have sex with people you don\'t know.  I watch stupid people who drunkenly think they\'re attractive or charming shamelessly hit on everything that moves every single night.  And it pretty much all men doing it to women.  Guys, LEAVE THEM ALONE.  If you want to try, try from a distance. \r\n\r\nIf you\'re going to flirt, be respectful,  Take a refusal as such, and go away.  Please remember that your target is probably drunk too, and that her judgement is just as screwed up as yours is.  Go away, do not press the matter, do not call her names.  Go away and keep your pride.  There are plenty more fish in the sea.\r\n\r\nRemember at all times that the kind of person who will go home with a stranger met in a bar is the kind of person who might be  carrying HPV, the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer; HSV, the virus that causes herpes; or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  This is the year 2005 and these are the facts: 70-80 percent of the human population carries or is infected with HPV.  30 percent of the sexually active American population carries or is infected with HSV.  .03 percent (three in one thousand) of the US population carries or is infected with HIV.  Sexy!\r\n\r\nWhat happens between consenting adults is no one\'s business but their own, and that does include what happens when they\'re drunk.  But most people have had an experience like waking up in a strange bed and wondering if that large sex toy on the nightstand is the reason for that strange pain.  Or worse, wondering why the condoms on the nightstand are unopened.  These scary feelings are often accompanied by hairy teeth, light sensitive eyes, a cold sweaty headache, and vomiting.  Screw all the strangers you want; it\'s your right to do so with all who consent.  Alcohol, however, really distorts the desirability of most people.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can\'t remember all this because you\'re too drunk, just remember that the better you treat us the better we\'ll treat you.  Or at least remember not to be a complete asshole and make us want to run you into tables, walls, railings, doors or windows.  That would hurt.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','41');

Oh, God, _YES!_\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Yahoo tipped like a punk-ass, but did remind me that every word in the English language has a distinct meaning, and that those who misuse meaning through ignorance or direct intent should be boiled alive in margarine.

Why would anyone do that?  Isnâ€™t that illegal?  Thereâ€™s no way my bartenderâ€™d do that to me.â€_ <br/>\r\n*Jamie <br/>\r\nPortland, Oregon*\r\n\r\nWell, Jamie, itâ€™s like this: the alcoholic beverage industry is just that, an industry.  It is designed to make as much money as possible for those who own it.  Not that thatâ€™s bad; all business owners usually wish to make money, myself included.  The booze brokers, however, have to convince rational people with working taste buds to drink poisonous tasting poison.\r\n\r\nThere is one easy way to do this: wait until the drinker is older.  Our taste buds age and become less sensitive to such things as cigars, spices, and whiskey.  Thatâ€™s why Scotch is typically seen as an older personsâ€™ drink, as are gin Martinis.  To young mouths those drinks are too strong (before you write letters, yes I do know how cool you are and that you drink Scotch at twenty-two.  I never insinuated that it was an affectation and that you are a poser).\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=bitchkittyrac-20&o=1&p=15&l=st1&mode=kitchen&search=martini&nou=1&fc1=&lt1=_blank&lc1=&bg1=&f=ifr\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" width=\"470\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nBut what of the eighteen to thirty year-olds?  How can the business of booze sell alcohol this demographic?  With mixers!  Fruit juice and soda pop are by far the most popular mixers.  They are consumed by the hogshead in any bar, an absolutely essential tool to increasing sales or, indeed, having any sales at all.  I have always suspected that sweet cocktails were introduced during Prohibition to cover up the taste of the cheap, nasty booze that was available then, the only way to drown out the harsh flavors that come from too little pride in oneâ€™s product.  This is just a pet theory of mine. \r\n\r\nLetâ€™s pretend for a moment we are bar owners.  How do we make the most money?  How can we get the most profit per cocktail?  First thing: use cheaper booze.  Very few customers order by brand; most order by cocktail name.  The guest orders a Cape Cod, not a Grey Goose with cranberry juice.  The bar will generally buy the cheapest booze it can for the nonspecific â€œwell drink.â€  For the consumer, it is generally never a good idea to order off the well, but to order the best product one can afford.  \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nHigher quality spirits take higher quality ingredients to produce.  Higher quality spirits take more time to produce.  Higher quality spirits take more care to produce.  This quality costs the producer money, so the producer charges the customer more.  What does the consumer get out of this?  Number one: flavor.  Higher quality spirits taste better.  Number two: purity.  Higher quality spirits contain fewer impurities, because the producer has taken the time to get the impurities out.  Alcohol is a poison; the consumer wants the cleanest poison possible.  It is the impurities that cause nastiest hangovers, the impurities which can make the difference between high and sick.  No caring producer is going to use cheap or impure ingredients.  Their name rides on the quality of their product.\r\n\r\nAs bar owners, how else can we make money?  Use cheaper mixers.  Cheap mixers, like cheap alcohol, are lower quality.  They contain high fructose corn syrup, coloring, preservatives, and artificial flavors.  The producers seem to value consistency of product over quality of product, even though juice is an agricultural crop and will vary from year to year.  \r\n\r\nAlso, as bar owners we need to spend as little as possible on fruit, used for both juice and garnish.  After all, garnish is disposable, isnâ€™t it?  We buy fruit from around the world that has been picked unripe, dyed or painted, gassed, irradiated, waxed with a petroleum distillate like olefin or paraffin, boxed, stored, container shipped, and stored again.\r\n\r\nYuck!\r\n\r\nAnother way a bar can save money is on water filtration.  There are cities full of bars without filters, and this lets municipal tap water into your drink.  This water is clean and deemed safe; I am not saying anything to the contrary.  I personally use it for everything but drinking.  I donâ€™t even mind the taste, but I _can_ taste it.  Itâ€™s preserved with chlorine and fluoridated.  Filters remove that taste, but filters are expensive.\r\n\r\nJamie, your bartender does not hate you, I swear.  The bar owner is just trying to stay in business, a business that has a fifty percent failure rate, a business with a very narrow profit margin, a business in a highly changeable and volatile environment.  Everyone else does business this way; why shouldnâ€™t he?  After all, youâ€™re still buying his product.  He wonâ€™t change until you ask him to; so ask him to.\r\n\r\nIf you want better drinks, go to better bars.  Ask what liquor theyâ€™re putting in your cocktail, and make sure the ingredients meet with your standard of quality.  Just as there is a plethora of restaurant dedicated to fresh, high-quality ingredients, there is a plethora of bars dedicated to the same.\r\n\r\nAlso, when making drinks at home, check the quality of your ingredients.  Use organic produce whenever possible.  Use good booze.  Use filtered water, even for ice.  The quality of drinks you can make at home should far exceed the quality of drinks you can get at a bar because you have both complete control of the ingredients and you have the luxury of time to prepare them.  You will be amazed at how crisp and clean your drinks taste.  Itâ€™s often not what is _in_ a cocktail, but what is _absent_ that makes it perfect.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','112');

Here it is: everyone hates you.  \r\n\r\nIâ€™m serious.\r\n\r\nI want you to think of your attitude towards drunk high-schoolers.  Your attitude can probably be summed up as something like, â€œThose bitches donâ€™t know SHIT!â€ because youâ€™re only twenty-one and you havenâ€™t learned how to speak yet.

Hereâ€™s the revelation: everyone in the bar is older and more experienced than you.  Everyone thinks youâ€™re an idiot.  And hereâ€™s another one for you: youâ€™re actually acting like an idiot without knowing it.\r\n\r\nIn order to be seen as the cool cat or kitten we know you are, here are some tips.\r\n\r\nDO NOT scream, â€œWHOOOO!!!â€ when you enter the bar, when you exit the bar, or at any point in your life, ever.  \r\n\r\nDO NOT say to the bartender: â€œItâ€™s my twenty-first birthday!  Whereâ€™s my free drink at?â€  Almost no one gives out free anything anymore, and drunks are a legal liability.  \r\n\r\nDO have your ID ready, and be prepared to politely thank the bartender for noticing itâ€™s your birthday.  You may get a free drink out of this gambit.  If so, DO tip the bartender five dollars.\r\n\r\nALWAYS say â€œpleaseâ€ and â€œthank you.â€\r\n\r\nDO tip the bartender at least one dollar per drink per round.  If you order three beers, tip at least three dollars every time.  If you canâ€™t afford this, stay home.  \r\n\r\nNEVER tell the bartender that youâ€™ll tip him next time.  If you canâ€™t afford to tip, you canâ€™t afford to drink.\r\n\r\nNEVER ask the bartender what the cheapest beer is, or whatâ€™s on special.  If you need to watch your cash like most young people, ask for a drink menu.  Asking what is cheap makes you look cheap.\r\n\r\nNEVER vomit in public.  If you feel sick, get your stupid ass to a bathroom or outside as quickly as possible.  If you throw up in a bar, expect the bartender or bouncer to do _really bad_ things to you.\r\n\r\nDO listen to the bartender.  If he tells you to leave, leave; if he tells you to shut up, shut up; etc . . .  Remember: he hates you.\r\n\r\nDO NOT give the cocktail waitress your phone number.  She hates you, too.  Sheâ€™s only flirting with you to increase her tip.  She actually thinks youâ€™re a douche bag, but canâ€™t tell you this and expect to get paid.\r\n\r\nDO NOT flirt too heavily with the opposite sex if youâ€™ve been drinking.  This is where rejection, crabs, herpes, and babies come from.\r\n\r\nDO be quiet.  You are much younger than everyone around you, and they think youâ€™re an idiot.  This may not be true, but again, think of how you view those in high school, even though theyâ€™re only three years younger than you.  \r\n\r\nDO NOT EVER get incoherently drunk in public.  We know this is almost completely unavoidable, but always remember to try and maintain your composure, no matter what.  Public drunkenness is the sign of the RFA (rank effing amateur).\r\n\r\nDO NOT EVER call the bartender: Slick, Dogg, Homie, Brother, Boss, Chief, Champ, or Sunshine.\r\n\r\nDO try to be as polite and respectful as possible to those around you.  You will gain the respect and admiration of others very quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd thatâ€™s probably more than your tiny little mind can absorb at once.  If you really want to be a player, or whateverthehell you kids\'re calling it these days, read the article â€œHow to Get Free Drinks in a Bar,\" posted \"here.\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/how-to-get-free-drinks-in-a-bar\r\n\r\nWe here at Bitch Kitty Racing wish you happy birthday!

I havenâ€™t been writing as much lately, the same late-Summer blockage I get every year, as if my brain will not let me miss an ounce of sunshine; it knows that the Nine Months of Drear are nigh, and that in just four short weeks there will be only six hours of light per day, torrential rains, and an average temperature of 40 degrees F.\r\n\r\nGotta love Seattle.\r\n\r\nSo, for the moment I am rocking out, truly getting my dance on the The Go! Team and cooking.  Yes, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™ve been these last four weeks, getting my OCD groove on in the kitchen, creating and testing and recreating old favorites, new syrups, fancy egg dishes, and going insane on French cuisine.  \r\n\r\nThere is a rush of French in Seattle right now.  We never had anything like â€œcuisineâ€ until the 1990â€™s and Tom Douglasâ€™s Asian Fusion cooking.  Maybe it was the 1980â€™s.  Point being, Fusion is now quite boring and perhaps weâ€™re trying to catch up to the rest of the world.  Weâ€™ve only been here for 150 years, and only had money enough to buy good food for the last twenty, so cut us some slack.  While there has always been a French restaurant in Seattle, now there are at least ten and they have started to reproduce.  \r\n\r\nSo, yes, while I am in the kitchen and missing the blue sky, I am also making parsnip puree.  Yes, I know parsnips are a Winter vegetable, but I couldnâ€™t wait.  Iâ€™m also frying chicken (Iâ€™ve become obsessed with fried things lately, compliments of \"Alton Brown\":http://www.altonbrown.com/) and concocting a rosemary Martini to go with all this.  \r\n\r\nCocktails have been long overlooked as aperitifs or social lubricant, nothing more.  They actually have a range and depth which is just now beginning to be explored.  While there is the candy variety designed to attract the younger drinker, there is now a movement to compliment the flavor of the base liquor with appropriate ingredients, not just slap mango in something.  \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=bitchkittyrac-20&o=1&p=15&l=st1&mode=kitchen&search=martini&nou=1&fc1=&lt1=_blank&lc1=&bg1=&f=ifr\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" width=\"470\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nPardon me.  I just had to switch the parsnips into the double boiler.\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, even apparently tasteless vodka has a definite palette (and itâ€™s really stupid to think that vodka is tasteless.  Why would they have all those tasting competitions?) to please the palate.  It doesn\'t need to be covered up with sugar.  Enough mango, already!  No more sickly sweet and syrupy cocktails designed to get Buffy the sorority girl to open her wallet wide and say, â€œAhhhh!â€  There is no way we would ever have corn syrup, artificial colors and flavors in our food.  Why in Godâ€™s name would we drink it?  \r\n\r\nYuck!\r\n\r\nNo more cranberry unless itâ€™s fresh.  No more â€œschnappsâ€ that is brighter than the neon lighting.  No more fun shots designed to prove how big the drinkerâ€™s penis is.  No more fake mixes, no more olefin on the fruit, no more bleach in the water, no more canned juice, no more fluorescent cherries.  \r\n\r\nAnd please, no more â€œclub drinks.â€  I had a seemingly reasonable young man ask me for a Corona beer with grenadine syrup in it.  I had another young man ask me for a Corona with a shot of lemon-flavored rum in it.  The trick for both of these is to pour out a little beer and replace it with the filler.  Oddly enough, both of these yahoos asked me what my strongest shot was.  I told them it was 151 proof rum, and they both declined.  Rum makers of the world, take note: make your strongest product taste like a Jolly Rancher and youâ€™ll sell billions of servings.  \r\n\r\nIt is possible to embrace and compliment the flavor of alcohol in a cocktail, though often times, especially with inferior product, itâ€™s preferable to cover that flavor up.  They actually sell grocery store-brand gin.

Movies, bungee jumping, and dating services, to name a few.  Then there is the biggest one of all, and also the easiest to overcome: marriage.  Marriage is the ultimate declaration of commitment between two people in love in modern America.  It is the beginning of a new family, the highest ideal.  Your spouse becomes the most important person in your life, even more so the parents or children, and also has the highest legal right to you, as well.  And because youâ€™re in love, mental sobriety tests should be administered before taking that vow, because Cupid has a very cruel sense of humor.\r\n\r\nTo get married means that you look into a personâ€™s eyes and say, â€œWeâ€™re one.â€  From the moment you make the engagement, this person will always be there, the bedrock of your daily life, more immovable than the Rocky Mountains, more permanent than death.  Love may come and go between you two, but the commitment lasts forever.  No matter what happens, no matter how mad you are, no matter how much you hate your spouse right now, sheâ€™ll always be there.  \r\n\r\nAt least until one of you dies.  \r\n\r\nSometimes marriage goes awry.  More than just sometimes, actually.  Currently one third of all marriages end in divorce, which is still better than the Boomer generation, when one half of all marriages ended in divorce.  So one third of all married couples will look at each other one morning and say, â€œYou miserable bitch, you ruined my life!â€  Okay, perhaps not so vehemently, but you get the idea.  The loving couple will seek to dissolve their vows.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem.  In order to get married in the first place, you have to play some serious mental tricks on yourself to suspend disbelief in statistics and cynics.  You have to trust your betrothed with your heart and family until you die, and this in a society that wonâ€™t talk to strangers, doesnâ€™t accept checks, and x-rays shoes, not to mention offers criminal background checks over the internet for $19.99.  \r\n\r\nAnd then to decide one day that your heart, soul, family, and future should not include your spouse?  That you would be better off alone?  So now you have to undo the knots you tied in your brain to get married in the first place.  That trust you felt in God and humanity when you first took her hand as your legal spouse?  Thatâ€™s gone forever.  That faith you felt in others when she said, â€œâ€™Til death do us part?â€  Youâ€™ll never believe anyone again.  That sense of never-ending security, of always knowing where home is?  Apparently your home is a rented apartment with crappy furniture.  \r\n\r\nThis is why divorce is so violent.  It tears up the most basic and essential part of a person.  Everything that is good about trust and commitment is embodied in marriage.  Everything that is bad about cynicism and bitterness is embodied in divorce.  Your childlike suspension of disbelief has been critically wounded by Cupidâ€™s arrow, and lies in the intensive care unit on a respirator.  \r\n\r\nSo to all the daters of divorcees, please keep in mind that you are the emotional equivalent of one who rescues a highly-abused pit bull terrier.  This dog will do everything in his power to make you happy out of sheer gratitude, but will never entirely trust you.  He will always be _en garde_ against the irrational.  His emotional responses will always be more intense than the situation warrants, for better or worse.  Neither will you entirely trust him, because you will always know that has already proven that he is capable of inflicting an insane amount of damage to another.  Youâ€™re dating a potential killer.   \r\n\r\nHey, good luck with that!\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','116');

You start looking around and going on platonic dates, or dates without heavily romantic overtones.  Just hanging out, more or less.\r\n\r\nThen the point comes where you start to become a little lonely, craving deeper intimacy.  You know youâ€™re not ready for it yet, but the craving is still there, and the longer you go single the more insistent the gnawing becomes.  You tell yourself to wait, to be patient. You tell yourself that Sunday nights, those nights when you and that someone just lie around on the couch in your pjâ€™s and eat takeout while watching movies, will happen again.\r\n\r\nYou canâ€™t rush intimacy.  It grows at a slow rate, and grows slower with every relationship.  Trust issues rear their ugly heads, or perhaps theyâ€™re actually believability issues, as in, â€œThis has happened a few times before.  How do I know itâ€™s real?â€\r\n\r\nThen another craving starts, a craving for sex.  You donâ€™t necessarily want to reproduce, but youâ€™d at least like to practice the reproductive act.  As an adult, you know damned well that easy sex is anything but, and has serious emotional ramifications if what youâ€™re actually craving is intimacy.  Easy sex just leaves you feeling sad in theses cases because you wanted something more.  Even if you decide to just get laid you have to pick a partner carefully, one who is on your page and wonâ€™t read anything more into it, one who isnâ€™t slutty enough to pose a health hazard, and one who wonâ€™t text you eight times a night looking for more.\r\n\r\nWhat a conundrum!  You want intimacy and arenâ€™t ready for it, you want sex but donâ€™t know if you can deal with it, you want intimate sex but canâ€™t have it without a relationship and you canâ€™t have a relationship because youâ€™re not ready for intimacy.\r\n\r\n_Zut alors!_\r\n\r\nI was actually contemplating these very arguments while sipping a Martini in a crowded Friday night bar.  I was watching the mating game play out and taking notes when I spied a very odd threesome sitting at a table just within earshot.  I had to stare without staring; they were so strange looking!  If I thought it was possible I would swear to you that what I saw sitting at that table, sharing a bottle of Absinthe, was a brain holding two leashes, attached to which were a heart on crutches and a libido that kept swiveling its head and looking at every woman in the place.  They were in agitated conversation, and every so often the brain would jerk the leads.  When I listened more closely, I could hear that they were discussing the very thoughts that wafted in the periptery of my head.\r\n\r\n!/img/243.png!\r\n\r\nThe Heart was speaking:  â€œWhat about Emily?  Weâ€™ve dated her quite a few times.  Sheâ€™s even spent the night.â€\r\n\r\nBrain replied, â€œShe told us she doesnâ€™t want a boyfriend.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI know, but we hold hands all the time and sheâ€™s so pretty!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAre you new?!  _Doesnâ€™t. Want.  A boyfriend.â€_\r\n\r\nâ€œBut . . .â€ pleads Heart.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo!  She doesnâ€™t want that kind of relationship.  If she did, sheâ€™d probably say something to the effect that she _wants_ a boyfriend.  Telling someone to go away is a very ineffective method of attracting someone, and chasing someone who just told you to go away is masochistic stupidity.  No!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBut we see Emily at least twice a week!  She must want more!â€\r\n\r\nBrain shook his lobes sadly.  â€œDo you remember, my muscle-headed little friend, seeing Alice four times a week?  Do you remember her telling you at the beginning she didnâ€™t want a relationship?  Do you remember falling in love anyway?  Do you remember how badly that ended?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOh.  Yeah,â€ said Heart.  â€œThat sucked.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYes.  Yes it did.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œHey, what about Brigit?  Sheâ€™s nice, we hold hands all the time and sheâ€™s so pretty!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œGod, youâ€™re slutty!â€ exclaimed Brain, amazed at Heartâ€™s quick change in target.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m not slutty.  Iâ€™m popular.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYeah, I guess sluts actually try to get screwed; you just wind up that way.â€\r\n\r\nHeart pressed on, â€œBut what about Brigit?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBrigit lives in Ireland, dumbass.  Sheâ€™s just here visiting.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBut . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re not moving to Ireland.â€\r\n\r\nHeart was silent for moment.  â€œOh!  I know!  Candice!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œCoworker.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œPheobe?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œMoving away in six months,â€ says Brain.\r\n\r\nâ€œJanine?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œIn a relationship.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBut . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t make me hurt you.â€  Brain sipped angrily on his drink.\r\n\r\nHeart was not to be deterred.  â€œWell, what about . . .â€\r\n\r\nBrain shut him down.  â€œWhat the hell is wrong with you?!  Am I going to have to put a shock collar on you?  Zap you every time we meet a woman?  Relax.  Wait.  Be patient.  There will be someone appropriate at some time in the future, and I will not have you running amok and otherwise involved when that time comes.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSo, uh, weâ€™re looking then?â€ \r\n\r\nâ€œJesus!  No!  Where the hell did you get that?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou said, â€˜There will be someone appropriate . . .â€™  That means weâ€™ve started looking.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou canâ€™t even walk right yet!  Stop it!â€ said Brain, with a particularly vicious jerk on the leash.\r\n\r\nLibidoâ€™s head finally stopped swiveling for a moment at the correction.  He interjected, â€œDude.  Itâ€™s time.  Let the little guy go.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOh, great,â€ sneered Brain.  â€œTweedle-Dum made the party, too.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t make me flood you with hormones, squishy.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t force me into celibacy, dickface.  Time for what?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSex,â€ said Libido.  â€œSex.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œReally,â€ said Brain.  â€œAnd whom do you propose as the willing recipient of our emotionless ardor?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI really donâ€™t care.  Anyone.  What about Emily?  Sheâ€™s totally hot.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œIf we sleep with Emily, Little Mr. Bloody Pants will attach himself to her and will probably never walk again when it ends. You know damned well he likes her, and you also know damned well how easy he is.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSo?  Just get him so drunk he doesnâ€™t remember it.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œFirstly, at high levels alcohol is a vasoconstrictor, meaning you have a high probability of being useless.  Secondly, if weâ€™re that drunk weâ€™ll wake up next to her and Heartâ€™ll know what happened.  Thirdly, if we wake up next to her and Iâ€™m too hungover to control you, youâ€™ll have sex with her again and he will definitely attach himself then.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou always say that sex is better with intimacy.â€\r\n\r\nBrain jerked on Libidoâ€™s lead.\r\n\r\nâ€œOw!  Donâ€™t do that again.â€  \r\n\r\nâ€œThen donâ€™t be stupid again.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œHow is that stupid?â€ said Libido angrily.\r\n\r\nâ€œBecause, prick, for starters, if Heart is hung up on someone he canâ€™t have heâ€™ll spend all his time moping and youâ€™ll get even less than youâ€™re getting now.  Heâ€™ll be so sad and drippy that I wonâ€™t even be able to think.  If weâ€™re going to do this, if weâ€™re going to do anything at all, we need to work together.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYouâ€™re right.  Youâ€™re right.  Iâ€™m sorry,â€ said Libido, suddenly contrite.  â€œLetâ€™s make up.  Here, letâ€™s have a toast to teamwork!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œTo teamwork!â€ They drank.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the effects of the Martini I was drinking, but as I watched Brain call for another bottle he suddenly became a little fuzzy at the edges, a little indistinct.  Heart seemed to develop a thin shell, like he was suspended in a thin layer of ice, while Libido appeared much sharper, almost feral.  I rubbed my eyes, but they still looked the same.  I leaned in and listened more closely.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat if we had sex with someone we didnâ€™t know that well?â€ asked Libido, refilling all three glasses.  â€œYâ€™know, just to keep in practice?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI just donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea right now,â€ answered Brain.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™d kind of like to, though, â€œsaid Heart.  â€œIâ€™m lonely, and maybe a little companionship would help to ease the pain.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI mean, really, Brain, look at you,â€ said Libido.  â€œYou canâ€™t even think straight, itâ€™s been so long.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWell . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œCome on, Brain!â€ said Heart.  â€œWe havenâ€™t even flirted in God only knows how long. Look at all the attractive people here.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œLetâ€™s say we were going to think about doing this,â€ said Brain.  â€œWhom would you two retards propose?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSo weâ€™re going to try?â€ said Libido.  â€œFinally!  This deserves a drink!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBut only, only if this drooling idiot doesnâ€™t get involved,â€ added Brain, indicating Heart.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m the idiot?â€ said Heart testily.  â€œReally.  What makes you so smart anyway?  Why are all of our relationships so screwed up?  Huh?  Iâ€™m not the one who stresses out and overthinks every little thing she does.  Iâ€™m not the one who frets and worries about what the definition of the relationship is, or where itâ€™s going.  You are!  Youâ€™re the one who screws everything up!  Youâ€™re the fucking problem, here!  Not me!â€\r\n\r\nBrain angrily jerked on the lead, but Heart quickly stood up in defiance.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhoa, guys, whoa!â€ said Libido, moving between them.  â€œCalm down here!  Just relax.  Weâ€™re all in this together, remember?â€  He poured out three more glasses.  â€œCome on, letâ€™s just have a drink, you know?  We can think about sex later.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI really hate you sometimes,â€ said Brain to Libido.  â€œI am so fucking sick of having to consider you.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œLook, Iâ€™m not the problem here,â€ said Libido.  â€œYou are.  Heartâ€™s got a point.  Itâ€™s your thoughts that control us.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œHey!â€ objected Brain.  â€œIâ€™m not the one who wants to bury his head in half the women we meet!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYeah, but be that as it may, you are the one who dictates how we do it.  I just want sex. Iâ€™m relatively innocent.  I donâ€™t have preferences or proclivities.  Youâ€™re the one who needs to have sex a certain way, or with certain body types, or with certain _things_ involved.  Not me.  You.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œLook,â€ said Brain, standing up again.  â€œIâ€™m not the one who canâ€™t control himself.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNo, youâ€™re not,â€ replied Libido smugly.  â€œYouâ€™re the one who canâ€™t control _me.â€_\r\n\r\nBrain yanked the leash hard enough to bring Libido to his feet, but Libido was expecting it and used the motion to leap over the table punching as Brain fell backwards.  Heart came at Brain from the other side, kicking and stomping him, grinding him in the shattered Absinthe bottle.  The table fell over in a cracking of wood, the waiters became involved, the other patrons hooted and shouted in glee at the spectacle.\r\n\r\nI closed my notebook quietly and slipped out the back door.\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','117');

Don\'t get me wrong, I love sex.  We\'re like this (holds up two crossed fingers).  But, you see, I\'ve had sex before.  I\'ve never had a \"1961 Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato.\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB4_GT_Zagato\r\n\r\nBesides, what is the best sex of your life?  It\'s a difficult question.  I\'d have to say the best sex of my life so far has been when I desire the person most, i.e. when I\'m in love.  Everyone knows that kind of love, when the mere presence of the person in the room sparks a desire for intimacy.  Not sex, particularly, but intimacy.  You\'ve already had sex and are truly, deeply, madly in love with one another.  You want to be as close as possible to your love.  That kind of sex has such a bonding experience woven into it that it\'s positively trancendental.  You want to be wholly inside the other person, like you want to eat her or have her somehow inhabit your skin.  It\'s far more than just intercourse. \r\n\r\nThen there\'s really hot sex, the sex you remember for the rest of your life.  It may have been a one-off, it may have been a passing lover, it may have been a girlfriend.  It\'s the sex you think about during masturbation.

You can\'t be around her without acting like an idiot.  Sometimes it\'s love, but most often it\'s lust.  You know damned well a relationship is impossible, but you\'re at least going to see her naked.  This can be the hottest one-night stand on the planet, or it can be a relationship that drags on way too long because the sex is so phenomenal. It\'s different than really hot sex because it\'s a direct product of the person you\'re with rather than what you did with that person. \r\n\r\nWhat other kinds of sex are there?  I\'m sure there are several thousands.  For me, though, I\'m going say the best sex is really hot sex with someone you can\'t resist with whom you happen to be madly in love.

He\'d been blasted a few times and thought he knew everything from the experiences, so occasionally he\'d get careless and lose another finger.  He thought this made him stronger.\r\n\r\nOne day he set out to blast a vertical tunnel in search of gold.  It was the damndest hole to get into, a tiny diamond-hard opening leading into much softer rock.  In order to set the explosives to get the gold he actually had to chain himself up in the opening of the hole in such a manner that he couldn\'t move if the explosion went awry.  If all went well, the explosions would break his chains and he would be able to let himself gently down.  He would suffer a bit, but he was sure it was nothing he couldn\'t live through.\r\n\r\nSo he looked at the problem, studied the rock, chose his explosives carefully.  He knew it was dangerous, but he was so confident in his ability that he failed to notice that down is one thing, but out is quite another.  He had, in effect, created a giant cannon with himself blocking the opening. \r\n\r\nStill, his ability was great.  He deftly placed a small explosive and lit the fuse.  He was tough.  He could take a little pain.  Look at his scars!   There were some things that he failed to take into account, though. The explosive was mislabeled and much more powerful than it looked.  It was packed into the softer rock, but unfortunately that rock was backed by the diamond-hard stuff. \r\n\r\nBOOM!\r\n\r\n\"Jumping donkey-riding Jehosephat!\" screamed the miner.  \"OWWWWWW!!!!\"  For, you see, the explosion had vaporized all of his clothing, as you might imagine, as well as the first forty-eight layers of skin.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been swimming in heavy surf all day?  Your skin is so raw by nightfall that your clothes actually stick your skin because it is weeping.  It\'s like a skinned knee all over your body, or a blistering sunburn that never stops stinging.  Unfortunately, the miner was much, much worse. \r\n\r\nAnd even more unfortunately, he was still chained to the rock. \r\n\r\nSo then the ants came to drink his fluids, and they irritated him so that he wept for frustration; had he not chained himself to the rock he could have just swept them away. Then the monkeys came and threw rotten fruit at him and he wept for frustration again; had he not chained himself he could have just thrown a few rocks back at them to show them who was boss.  Then the vultures came and began to tear at his flesh and the miner screamed and wailed and gnashed his teeth in frustration; if he were not chained he would rip the heads off those birds and eat them raw!\r\n\r\nAlas, he had chained himself to rock and all he could do was pray for his own survival while he waited for the chains to rust away.\r\n\r\n_This article is sponsored by:_ \"The Bitch Kitty Store\":/bitch-kitty-records/store','138');

Well, my own car was making this noise so I took it to my dealer, Northwest Mini, where Steve the service technician got into my car for a ride.  \"I hope this isn\'t a wild goose chase,\" he said. \"It\'s Friday and I have a lot of work backed up.\"   Steve apparently had better things to do than address my concerns.\r\n\r\nAfter a ten minute ride the noise still hadn\'t appeared.  Steve seemed vindicated and got out of my car with an invitation to bring it back for a check if the noise popped up again.  \"But what am I supposed to do in the meantime?\" I asked.  \"There\'s something wrong with my car or it wouldn\'t be making that noise at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drive it until it breaks,\" said Steve.  \"We\'ll find the problem then.\"\r\n\r\nAs I drove away I had the feeling that I\'d just been completely dismissed by someone with more knowledge than me, like the feeling I used to get when my old plumber would adopt a haughty tone and started telling me about pipes and seals and flux and about how this was going to go over estimate, _sorry._  \r\n\r\nI fired that plumber.  He wasn\'t the only game in town.  My new plumber is the kind of guy who takes joy in ripping out old pipes with a sawzall and generally creating huge messes.  He\'s a kid with power tools.  In the middle of the mess he\'ll call out, \"Hey John?  I\'ve found the problem!\"  And then he\'ll show me what is wrong, why it failed, and what he\'s going to do about it. He takes pride in _fixing_ the problem, not just repairing it.  I have no doubt that he knows what he\'s doing because he very clearly explains it to me in language I will understand.  When I get the bill I know why I\'m paying it.\r\n\r\nAnd so I fired Mini Dealer Service.\r\n\r\nI admit I\'m partly to blame for not immediately going to the service manager and explaining what happened, giving him a chance to make the situation right.  I\'m sure he would have dealt with Steve (or at least re-trained him in customer service) and given me another tech.  Mini service is usually excellent.  But then again, I expected the service to be right the first time.\r\n\r\nI do not drive very often.  An average month will see me put maybe 400 miles on my beloved car.  As I drove away from the dealership I decided to live with the noise and see what transpired; maybe Steve was right, the problem would get bad enough to be more easily diagnosed and repaired.  The service manager, Terry, had assured me when I reported the problem the first time (yes, dealing with Steve was the second attempt at fixing this) that, because the problem was reported under warranty, it would be dealt with under warranty.\r\n\r\nOn the way home I had to drive on I-5, a nightmare of construction, ruts, cracks, and holes, i.e: a normal road.  The Mini made the noise immediately after getting on the freeway, and popped along cheerily all the way home.  (For reasons known only to themselves, Mini opened up their dealership in Tacoma, thirty traffic-choked miles south of Seattle, the major population center of the Pacific Northwest.)  By the time I got home I realized I didn\'t entirely trust the car anymore.  It had a weak point, or it wouldn\'t be making any noise at all.  It\'s a newer car and newer cars do not make strange noises.\r\n\r\nSo for the last year I have been enjoying my car less.  I do not want to drive it hard for fear that something will fail catastrophically, and I bought it because it is a joy to drive hard.  MiniUSA published an enitre section on their website on competition autocrossing, so I must assume they endorse hard driving.  My joy is gone.  The car needs new tires, badly at this point, but I was holding off until I found out what was wrong.  Why ruin a set of tires on a front end that moves around disordedly?  If it wasn\'t moving around disorderedly there would be no noise.\r\n\r\nOil change time, almost one year later.  Luckily enough I ran into a college buddy who worked at a high-end shop, the kind that never advertises based on price, but on service. They keep records on your car and care for it better than the dealer -- that\'s their competetive advantage.  They work to foster a long relationship with the customer.  Come to think of it, they remind me very much of my vet.\r\n\r\nMy new mechanic, Eric, was at the Vehicle Research Institute with me at Western Washington University.  I trust him implicitly because he\'s another car guy with a Bachelor of Science in Vehicle Design, and we also worked on the same race team.  He\'s also a kid with toys.  I asked him about the noise.\r\n\r\n\"I\'ll look into it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI picked up my baby the next day, washed, polished, and cared for.  Eric showed me the Mini Service Bulletin that covered my noise.  May I restate that?  Mini has _published_ the symptoms and the cause.  This information is available to all those with access to Mini Service Bulletins, like, say, a Mini dealership.\r\n\r\n_!!!_\r\n\r\nThe noise is caused by a mushroomed strut tower crown, a very common problem with these tightly-sprung little cars.  Let me see if I\'m as good as my plumber at explaining it:\r\n\r\nI want you to flap one hand. Just relax your wrist and FLAP FLAP FLAP.  That\'s your car\'s spring.  Now go stick your hand in a bathtub filled with water and flap it again.  It\'s harder, isn\'t it?  The full range of motion is still there, but it is _dampened_ by the water.  I\'m going to Hell for that pun, but the water is your car\'s motion dampeners, be they called struts or shock absorbers.  They allow the movement of the spring but do not allow it to be so violent that your car hops off the road.\r\n\r\nNow imaging flapping your hand in a coffee can filled with water.  The motion is still dampened, but you\'re rapping your knuckles on the sides of the can.  The _range of motion_ is limited by the sides of the can.  If you really tried hard enough you could actually hit the can hard enough to bend it, so your car is designed to absorb this impact with _bump stops_ that distribute the force over a large surface area so there is no bending.\r\n\r\nImagine holding a coffee cup upside down with a pencil in it.  The pencil is the dampener (strut, in this case), the eraser is the bump stop, and the coffee cup is the _strut tower crown._  Tap the bottom of the pencil and the eraser deforms a little to spread the impact over a larger surface area so the cup doesn\'t break.  If you used something like a screwdriver with a very fine point the cup would shatter.\r\n\r\nIn the Mini Cooper S, the range of motion in the suspension is very limited to improve handling.  Imagine dropping an egg onto pavement.  It breaks.  Now drop the egg onto a piece of foam from the same height.  The foam has to be thick enough or dense enough to cushion the fall or the egg will break.  The egg is our strut tower crown, and the foam is our springs (and also, to a lesser degree, our struts).  The thickness of the foam is our range of motion.  If the foam were of a very dense variety, it could be thinner and still cushion the egg.\r\n\r\nThe Mini Cooper S has a thin but dense foam, but it is not enough to fully cushion the egg. At full compression of the springs and dampeners, the bounding motion of the wheel is absorbed by the the strut tower crown.  The strut tower crown has to be strong and tough enough to take the impact -- there\'s nowhere else for the impact to go.  The Mini Cooper S does not have strong enough strut tower crowns and they are notorious for mushrooming.\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you about the suggested repair: I called Northwest Mini and the service technician told me he\'d pound the strut tower crown back in shape with a piece of wood, and that it would probably cost me $600.\r\n\r\n_What?!_\r\n\r\nDo you know how to break a wire?  You bend it back and forth until it snaps.  What is actually going on is called _stress hardening._  Every time you stress/bend the wire it gets harder/stiffer at the molecular level until it loses all toughness and becomes brittle enough to break.\r\n\r\nAnd, dear Mini, you want to make brittle a piece of my car that is already weak?  \r\n\r\n_Really._  \r\n\r\nThat\'s INSANE.  The metal would lose the toughness that allows it to absorb impact.  It would be more likely to crack if it bends again, which is likely because the root cause of the problem is not addressed.  It\'s like repairing a ceiling after water has dripped through it from a leaky pipe _without fixing the leaky pipe._\r\n\r\nMini has provided a repair, but no fix.  They also refuse to cover this repair under warranty, stating that the problem is caused by \"accident damage.\"  If the car was sold only for competition, I would understand this kind of damage resulting from normal street driving, but this is not a competition-only vehicle: it is a street car, designed to be driven over real-world conditions like cobblestones and potholes.  You cannot design a car that cannot hit the occasional pothole without damage, but that\'s what Mini has done.\r\n\r\nThe weak strut tower crown is a design flaw.  If it was designed correctly the car would not fail at this point as so many have.  A design flaw is not the consumers\' fault; it is the fault of the manufacturer.  Why should the consumers have to pay for it?  Why isn\'t there a Mini-approved fix for it, instead of just a ridiculous repair?\r\n\r\nThank the entire pantheon of automotive gods that there is a fix for this problem and I found it available at most shops _other than Mini dealer service._  I will have to discuss all my options with Eric and see what will work best with my needs, but the cause of the failure will be _fixed_ and failure will not occur again.\r\n\r\nShame on you Mini and your parent company BMW!  You have documented the problem to your own service departments.  It\'s all over the web as a major weakness of your otherwise wonderful little car.  You have been good enough to replace what needed to be replaced, you have been good enough to inform me of recalls and care for them promptly, your dealer and its service department are generally quite wonderful (minus Steve, never-returned calls, long lead time, and location), and the car itself is a joy.\r\n\r\nThis problem is unacceptable.  You must take responsibility for it and install the necessary components that prevent the problem from occurring.  You must correctly fix all cars that have been damaged as a result of this flaw.\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, I am loathe to either buy or recommend another Mini.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=bitchkittyrac-20&o=1&p=15&l=st1&mode=automotive&search=Mini%20Cooper&nou=1&fc1=976621&lt1=_blank&lc1=757A6E&bg1=30322D&f=ifr\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" width=\"468\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','140');

Over a mutual fit of the giggles and an opening salvo of frites, I noticed a woman at a table behind my date checking me out, and not in a good way.  She was in a lively conversation with her dinner companion, also a woman, and would glare over at me disapprovingly from time to time, as if for punctuation.  When Esther excused herself for a moment, she walked by this irritated womanâ€™s table.  The woman watched Esther for a moment, then looked me directly in the eye, scoffed, turned her head, and rolled her eyes. \r\n\r\nBeing male, I am well acquainted with that dance.  To verbalize it, one says simply, _â€œMen!â€_ which translates to either: â€œAll men are children!â€ or â€œAll men are bastards!â€ depending on the context.  But I didnâ€™t know this scoffing woman.  What was going on here?  Was I being gauche by ordering French fries as an appetizer?  Did she not like my tie?  Did the slinky girl I was out with not match my jacket?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&offerid=78524.10000011&type=3&subid=0\">iTunes:&nbsp;The&nbsp;world\'s&nbsp;best&nbsp;digital&nbsp;jukebox,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;#1&nbsp;music&nbsp;download&nbsp;store&nbsp;inside.</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&bids=78524.10000011&type=3&subid=0\">\r\n\r\nAs Esther sat down, both women at the opposing table turned to glare at me, still talking heatedly.  Apparently my existence was a personal affront to them.  I felt very much like I had just been caught looking at the lingerie section of the Macyâ€™s insert in the Sunday paper.\r\n\r\nThe waiter brought the Vin de Savoie.  â€œIâ€™m sorry, Miss,â€ she said to Esther, â€œI forgot to check your ID.â€  She examined the required document and I hoped she wouldnâ€™t ask for mine, a pointless formality Iâ€™ve always found quite stupid and vaguely insulting.  It assumes the older person at the table needs to look young in order to feel validated and have high self esteem.\r\n\r\nScrew that.  \r\n\r\nI donâ€™t have to look young.  My date looks young, and that makes me look rich.  For empty vanities, looking rich is far better than looking young.  \r\n\r\nAfter we ordered, I asked Esther what a she thought about the table behind her.\r\n\r\nâ€œLet me guess,â€ she said.  â€œFrosted hair, coral lipstick?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYeah.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œTwice my age?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAt least,â€ I replied.\r\n\r\nâ€œHave you ever heard the line, â€˜Men get distinguished; women get discarded?â€™ â€œ\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat does that mean?â€ I asked.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt means that men get more attractive as they age, or become patrician, maybe.  Perhaps itâ€™s just that age isnâ€™t seen as a detriment to their attractiveness.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œPerhaps men become more masculine as they age,â€ I said, espousing a view Iâ€™ve previously espoused.\r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s a good way of looking at it.  But women arenâ€™t viewed as becoming more feminine as they age.  They become crones, hags, old maids.â€ Esther said.\r\n\r\nâ€œOh, come on,â€ I said.  â€œThere are lots of attractive older women: Isabella Rossellini, Catherine Deneuve, Melanie Griffith . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd there are lots of crappy-looking older men, but women are societally viewed as less attractive as they get older, and men arenâ€™t.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNot all women get left for younger women by their spouses,â€ I countered.  â€œMy grandparents are still together, my parents are both with people their own age, my friends parents, your parents . . .  I understand that younger women might be seen as more attractive, but not every man is going to abandon his family for one.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m talking about.  Itâ€™s more like choosing teams in grade school.  If you were choosing from a lineup for a potential mate, or sex partner, or whatever it is you bastards actually choose women for, and without knowing either of us, whom would you choose: me or one of the women behind me?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s not entirely fair, though.  If I didnâ€™t know any of you, Iâ€™d merely be picking a date based on attractiveness, and you are way better-looking than either of them.â€\r\n\r\nEsther clapped her hands.  â€œExcellent!â€ she said.  â€œYouâ€™re well on your way to proving my point.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat do you mean?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œRun with me, here.  There are at least thirty women in this room.  Pick out the five most attractive ones.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSeriously?  Okay . . .â€  Picking out other women in front of a date.  Interesting.  â€œHer, in the red cocktail dress.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œTwenty-six,â€ commented Esther.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe waitress,â€ I said.\r\n\r\nâ€œ<em>Maybe</em> twenty-two.  You sure you donâ€™t like them young?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOkay, fine.  See that woman at the bar, the one with the white shirt?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThat woman has T&A for _days._  Even I want to do her.  Be serious.  Iâ€™ll shut up.â€\r\n\r\nSo I seriously thought about it.  I looked around the room and sized up all the women, trying to think with more than just my amygdala and make decisions based on rational factors like possible income bracket, profession, and car ownership.  If I were seriously trying to choose a mate without knowing her, whom would I really choose?\r\n\r\nâ€œYouâ€™re overthinking it,â€ said Esther.  â€œJust pick hot.â€\r\n\r\nI just went for it.  â€œHer, her, and her.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œTwenty-eight, thirty-one, and twenty-two.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œReally?â€  I looked harder at the women.  Esther was probably right.  It was hard to tell from this distance without my glasses.\r\n\r\nâ€œYour fictitious team of women are all younger than you.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYeah, but I just picked them based on how hot they were,â€ I said, immediately realizing Iâ€™d just hung myself.  â€œI mean . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œUh huh.  I know exactly what you mean.  You mean that out of thirty women with a median age of forty all the ones you find hot are thirty or younger.â€  \r\n\r\nâ€œWell, yeah, but look at it another way,â€ I attempted.  â€œIf my instincts, my _selfish genes_ are trying to reproduce . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t intellectualize this,â€ said Esther.  â€œThe women you picked out are attractive.  Just deal with it.  I mean, really, why are you out with me?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œ  . . . Because you asked me out?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSeriously, now.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBecause you can complete a sentence without using the word â€˜likeâ€™ and Iâ€™ve never seen you wear flip-flops.â€ \r\n\r\nâ€œReally,â€ said Esther, indignant.  â€œIs that all that separates me from all the other girls?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNo, but it is what separates you from all the other twenty-two year-old girls.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t get snotty with me.  Just own up to it: age is a factor in your definition of attractive.  You find me hot.â€\r\n\r\nI admitted it.  â€œYes.  You win.  I am out with you because you are hot,â€ I said.  â€œAnd, as you have proven, I am attracted to younger women, at least out of the women in this room.â€  I wasnâ€™t going down so easily, though.  â€œBut there is also this: you are _available._  Statistically speaking, there are more single women in their early twenties that there are single women in their mid-thirties.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s not really a factor here.  Say those two women behind me are single as well.  They obviously have more money than me, better cars, established careers, houses, taste, style, whatever.  They are established.  Why are you out with me and not one of them?  Iâ€™ll tell you why: Iâ€™m younger and better looking.  You have abandoned a woman your own age to be out with me based upon looks alone.â€  \r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s ridiculous!â€ I protested.  â€œWhom have I abandoned?  Iâ€™m single!â€ \r\n\r\nâ€œThatâ€™s completely irrelevant,â€ said Esther.  â€œYou know why those two women over there are talking about out you?  Because to them you are just another guy who is thinking with his dick and not his head; because if you were using your head youâ€™d be out with one of them and not with me. To them you are in control, you have the power.  They think youâ€™re just using me for sex, that you only want my perky breasts and firm bottom.  Or worse,\" she said, \"they think Iâ€™m trading hand jobs for tennis bracelets.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou sound a little bit pissed off about it, too.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI am a little.  I like to date older guys, and I get tired of being viewed by people that age as a hapless little brain-dead slut being used by the big strong man.â€\r\n\r\nThank heavens she had taken her spotlight off of me.  One of the worst parts about being a smart fool is that you feel twice as stupid when you realize youâ€™ve been eruditely justifying your ignorance.  â€œWhy do you like to date older guys?â€ I asked.\r\n\r\nâ€œOral sex,â€ said Esther.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuh?â€  \r\n\r\nâ€œSeriously.  Even if a guy is bad in bed, fifteen years additional practice will usually help.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYouâ€™re using _me_ for sex?!â€\r\n\r\nShe just laughed.  â€œNot yet!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThere must be something else,â€ I said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are lots of things.  When you date an older guy itâ€™s like dating a man from a foreign country.  No matter how strange what you do is, the foreign guy just blames it on the fact that youâ€™re American, and the older guy just blames it on the fact that youâ€™re twenty-two.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI would think that there would be a lot of other perks; the older guy usually has more money, a better car, takes you to nicer places, is more socially able, is more forgiving and less prone to weird emotional freak-outs . . .â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThereâ€™s all that, too,â€ she said.  â€œYou take me to very nice places, Mr. Moroney.  Most young men want to just hang out and go to a bar or something.  You at least attempt actual dates.  You also,â€ she paused briefly, â€œyou treat me like more of an equal.â€\r\n\r\nThat last sentence made my skin tingle.  An equal?  I thought about the girls I knew when I was twenty-two.  There were some that dated older guys, but my little clique was never entirely comfortable with the situation.  We always felt the girl was being used in exchange for feeling mature enough to handle an older boyfriend, and we always felt the boyfriend was frightfully immature.  This was just a date, but I suddenly thought I could hear my jesterâ€™s mortarboard jingling softly over the clinking silverware, laughing diners, and glaring older women.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&offerid=78524.10000011&type=3&subid=0\">iTunes:&nbsp;The&nbsp;world\'s&nbsp;best&nbsp;digital&nbsp;jukebox,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;#1&nbsp;music&nbsp;download&nbsp;store&nbsp;inside.</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&bids=78524.10000011&type=3&subid=0\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','141');

Oddly enough, the first reaction isnâ€™t, â€œWow, you are _such_ as asshole!â€ but rather, â€œWhat did I do to deserve that?!â€\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s correct some thinking, shall we?  When someone attacks you without defiance this person is crazy.  Sane people _do not_ intentionally hurt others.  Intentionally hurting another human being is eight kinds of crazy, itâ€™s what animals do because they want to eat you.  If a human being attacks you physically he goes to jail and learns about things called â€œprison pursesâ€ and â€œshanking.â€\r\n\r\nThe victim is hurt, shaking and has both physical and mental damage.  No rational person with even a dried-up dead mouse for a heart would blame the victim for the attack, _except the victim._\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t ever do that again.  Promise me you wonâ€™t.  Itâ€™s nuts.  A dirty cat box deserves better treatment than youâ€™re giving yourself.  You did nothing wrong.  You were attacked by an animal, it doesnâ€™t deserve rational thought spent on it because itâ€™s not a rational being, itâ€™s not human.  I donâ€™t care if it is judged by humans as a human, it just isn\'t.  To be human is to rise above our animal selves and _think._  We are tricky monkeys and sinners at birth, and it is our lifelong duty to make sure we never enter that state again.\r\n \r\nBeing cheated on is another kind of attack.  I want to make that absolutely crystal/diamond/glass/still mountain pond clear: an attack without defiance, unprovoked, no warning, just BAM with the baseball bat.  \r\n\r\nAnd this is supposed to be the victimâ€™s fault?  Huh?  How?  Everyone over the age of six knows that you do not cheat on your lover.  Thatâ€™s the tricky monkey part of us that we\'ve kept on which society is founded: we have evolved into monogamous creatures.  Our tricky monkey selves protect our nests and our spouses.  We do not cheat because the survival of the species depends on fidelity.  A tricky monkey female will not choose an obviously unfaithful male because he will not be there to raise the children.  A tricky monkey male will not choose a faithless female because he wonâ€™t know if those are his offspring.  We _instinctively_ don\'t like cheaters.\r\n\r\nYet there seems to be a lot of literature that suggests that somehow the victim might have driven his lover to it, or that men are hard-wired to attempt copulation with as many women as possible.  \r\n\r\nBullshit.\r\n\r\nTry justifying your cheating behavior to your lover.  â€œIâ€™m hard-wired horny, honey!â€ or, my personal favorite, â€œYou made me cheat on you!â€  What?  I made you hurt me?  No, no, no, no.  Thatâ€™s like those kids who windmill their arms and say that anyone who gets in the way is to blame for the punch.  Stop flailing, dumbass, you can really hurt someone.  And stop cheating, dumbass, because you already did.\r\n\r\nAnd being cheated on is probably the worst pain imaginable.  What we _are_ hard-wired to do is go completely atomic when we find out our lover has been unfaithful.  And you know whatâ€™s the best part?  Youâ€™re totally justified.  Set fire to his truck.  Beat her lover senseless with a dead skunk.  Itâ€™s called a crime of passion, and this is the one case where you can stand in a court of law and, even though you committed a serious crime and are going to jail, it really _is_ the victimâ€™s fault and everybody is on your side.  You may even get the electric chair, but everyone still knows you ex-lover is an asshole.  \r\n\r\nLetâ€™s look a little more closely at out cheaters, shall we?  First up, your lover.  Your lover who just attacked you without defiance by committing an act that is universally regarded as wrong.  Was she drunk and claims she didnâ€™t know what she was doing?  Thatâ€™s actually called rape, honey, and youâ€™d better be filing charges or Iâ€™m nailing your cat to the ceiling.  Was it just a physical thing for him?  Nice work, dude, admitting you don\'t use your brain.  What, you lack the mental faculty control normal urges?  Do you wet yourself, too?  Or is there a monster in your pants?  â€œI canâ€™t control my penis!  Help!  Help!  Itâ€™s running amok!â€\r\n\r\nEither way, neither person should be regarded as a human being any longer.  They have chosen not to act rationally, so why on earth do they try to rationalize their behavior?  Why would you treat them like a rational being?\r\n\r\nNow, I know this hurts and is so far beyond impacted-wisdom-tooth-extraction pain that it defies description, but you need a spine, like right now.  You DO NOT put up with this crap.  Your lover is dead, and what stands before you begging forgiveness is a lying butthead, farting out pleas and justifications.  Or even worse (I sincerely pray this never happens to anyone, but Iâ€™ve heard that it does), your lover seems nonchalant about it, like itâ€™s no big deal.  \r\n\r\nOuch!\r\n\r\nDid you feel the wood impact your teeth, there?  Did that hurt?  Is it your fault you got hit just because you happened to be standing there? \r\n\r\nAre you _kidding me?_\r\n\r\nStop crying and fight back!  Yell, scream, throw a huge fit, do some serious psychological maiming!  As long as you don\'t threaten, itâ€™s legal!  Point out all the other personâ€™s shortcomings real or imagined!  Make it hurt!  Youâ€™re being attacked by a rabid monkey!  Get it away from you!  Do not try to reason with it!  Inflict enough pain that it goes away!\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s the point of all this?  Number one: not only have you been attacked, your attacker now wants an emotional band-aid.  Itâ€™s like she punched you and cut her knuckle on your teeth, and now she wants you to make it all better.  Don\'t do it.  Just let her bleed out.  Let her writhe, the relationshipâ€™s completely fucked anyway, and at least you have your pride.  Let her feel guilty until she dies of it.  This ties into point number two: your lover needs to know he did something wrong.  Seriously, if you cave he will be absolved and not learn a valuable lesson.  Itâ€™s like a child who goes around punching people all the time.  It is only when someone finally pounds the snot out of that little turd that he thinks twice about punching someone else.  Pain is such an amazingly effective teacher. You want to make sure this little retarded monkey thinks twice before ever cheating on anyone again.  \r\n\r\nNow letâ€™s look at the cheatee, or (sorry, this is going to hurt) the person who had sex with your lover (sorry again.  Ouch!  I know, I know, but read on, it gets better).  The cheatee is, without a doubt, the most reviled figure on the planet.  Whom would you kill first?  Pol Pot or that guy who just fucked your wife?  See what I mean?  You might execute Pol Pot, but you would beat that other bastard to death with an axe handle and yet pray that he never dies so you might go on inflicting pain upon him.  \r\n\r\nWhoa!  That was really rather frighteningly violent, wasnâ€™t it?  But I have been cheated on before, and thatâ€™s what it made me feel.  And I am certainly not alone, not by a long shot.\r\n\r\nThe cheatee cares about nothing but herself.  She does not care the slightest damn for the person sheâ€™s fucking; if she did sheâ€™d realize sheâ€™s going to cause him endless pain, guilt, anger, and unhappiness.  She gives even less thought to the person thatâ€™s being cheated on.  The cheatee is nothing but a dumb beast, utterly inhuman.  In most societies (Iâ€™m pretty sure this is true) the cheated has a right to a gallon of the cheateeâ€™s blood.  Something like that.  If itâ€™s not already law we should put it up to popular vote, I bet itâ€™d pass on the first try.\r\n\r\nYet, I want you to do this if you can: put the cheatee out of your mind, at lest for now.  Revenge is a dish best served cold, and identity theft is _so_ anonymous these days . . . \r\n\r\nIâ€™m so sorry this has happened to you at all, but I always want you to remember that most people are not insane, most people do not cheat.  There are statistics, there are graphs, there are charts, but mostly thereâ€™s no one with a rational mind who cannot imagine the consequences, no one who cannot imagine how much it would hurt if it happened to them.  \r\n\r\nIâ€™m actually fairly certain that my grandmother just hit me on the back of the head from 350 miles away to remind me that we should always forgive, and quite honestly sheâ€™s right.  Itâ€™s easier to give up your anger than to hold it, and itâ€™s also the only way youâ€™ll ever get over it.  Anger hurts, let it go as soon as you can so you don\'t find yourself coddling a pain kitten.  But do not give up your right to be insanely pissed-off and hurt after you find out.  What your lover did to you is not okay, is completely unjustifiable, and was just flat-out wrong.  She just opened up your skull with a blunt object, or more precisely, she just broke your heart.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<em>Coda\r\n\r\nI initially started writing an article on cheating to answer a question for very dear friend of mine in Africa whom I love and respect very much.  She found herself in the role of The Other Woman.  At first I was trying to come up with a more realistic look at it, like \"it just happens\" or \"only after dark, never with the same person twice.\"  I had forgotten that just last year I was unfaithful to my lover and broke her heart.  I had forgotten what that felt like.  She tortured me for months and then broke up with me.  Then, like a giant cliche, I had a lover cheat on me. (Please don\'t say karma, say I went looking for some sort of absolution.)\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say, apparently by publicly announcing my assholery, is that I\'ve gotten some perspective on this topic in the last year, more than I could ever possibly want, actually.  And to my darling in Africa I say: stop it.  I will never stop loving you, but what you are doing is wrong.  There is no other answer I can give you from my front row seat.</em>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=bitchkittyrac-20&o=1&p=27&l=qs1&f=ifr\" width=\"180\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','145');

We become more interested in creating a home and protecting it, we develop an interest in children, many of us want to get married and get out of the dating game once and for all.  The sex drive has become somewhat muted, no longer the raging insistence that controls our every thought and emotion the way it did from the onset of adolescence through most of our twenties.  We develop hobbies, or take an interest in sport.  We have mellowed and become much more sure of ourselves.  We are entering our prime years, both physically and professionally.  We are finally fully adult males.  If we were gorillas, like many say we are, we would finally be getting our silver backs.\r\n\r\n!http://bitchkittyracing.com/page_attachments/4/112.jpg!\r\n\r\nOddly enough, God created woman differently.  With the physical onset of final adult form comes sexual primacy.  Once the hips and breasts have filled out in the late twenties she also begins to fully realize her personal and professional power.  This is the transformation from girl to woman, from giggling cheerleader to CEO.  She is also entering her prime, but suddenly wants a slightly different world than her male counterpart.\r\n\r\nObservational evidence suggests that women around or slightly past thirty have a sex drive that can be somewhat terrifying to the unsuspecting younger male.  Most men have had a lover of this age during their college-age years, and most men fondly remember their â€œteacher.â€  Men learn more about sex from this one woman than the ten age-appropriate girls that follow.  For the silver-backed adult male, these women are a sexual revelation.  They have the experience and stamina that every man craves.  They have the self-confidence to express their desires.  They transform from flirts to seductresses, from kittens to tigers.\r\n\r\nHis head snaps around when she enters the room, pheromonal heat radiating into his midsection.  Her body is full and fertile, primed for mating at seemingly all times.  His breath quickens, his eyes dilate, his nostrils flare.  His adorable twenty-three year-old date seems a bit vapid, comparatively.  He remembers they really have nothing in common but sex, and outside of her taut and nubile body thereâ€™s no real thrill, no consuming sexual passion, no irrefutable attraction.  He feels slightly embarrassed in front of the adult female, because sheâ€™s mocking him for dating such a stupid young thing, laughing at him.  Heâ€™s looking at an equal, something to conquer, something to fight with, someone who wonâ€™t wear out, someone he doesnâ€™t have to train.  His date begins to look younger and younger in his eyes; she lacks the appropriate curves that indicate sheâ€™s a woman and not a girl.  Men topple kingdoms for the love of queens; they merely fight over concubines.\r\n\r\nThe over-thirty male becomes confused after the sex by the fact that the over-thirty female doesnâ€™t call the next day, or even the next week.  He loved her conversation, her wit, her intelligence, and most of all the sex.  He enjoyed being around someone his own age and actually having things in common.  He thinks of her as a potential mate.  However, women of this age seem to have lost the urge to settle down.  They apparently have no use for the adult protector male.  They donâ€™t need him; they have enough power on their own.  Heâ€™s finally ready for kids; she is beginning her prime earning years and is not about to compromise her career.  He wants to build a home; she already bought and furnished her own.  He wants a soul-mate; she wants a bed-mate.\r\n\r\nThere is a common belief that men feel threatened by women with power, that these women are bitches or man-eaters.  Perhaps a more realistic truth is that men want to dominate these women because they are challenging.  Men badly want these women sexually but they seem to have no use for him.  He does want to dominate her; in order to have sex she must submit to the mechanical process of penis entering vagina, her body literally accepts the insertion.  The challenge of the female he canâ€™t have triggers the aggressive tendencies hardwired in the brain.  Unpleasant though it may be to admit, we are closely related to chimpanzees who routinely raid other troops for the purpose of stealing the females, often killing their opponents in the process.  Human males routinely fight over women, either in actual physical combat or posturing, fist fights or intellectual one-upmanship.  The human male may have a subconscious and unrealized desire to kill the opponent that stands in the way of the female he wants, all the more horrific if it is the female herself that is standing in his way.\r\n\r\nDating in the thirties is, by most accounts, a nightmare.  There are far fewer available and desirable long-term partners.  Many have already paired off, many are recovering from previous marriages, many just donâ€™t have the interest any longer.  There are several sayings, such as: â€œAll the good ones are taken or gayâ€ and â€œAll the available ones are crazy, have children, or both.â€  Prima facie, these sayings can be offensive.  A deeper look indicates the primal urge to pass on the individualâ€™s own genetic material.  The dating pool is smaller in the thirties, and it is fraught with divorcees and other peopleâ€™s children, with emotional scars and selfish behavior because of them.  The single person battles self-confidence issues, thinking: â€œIâ€™m not gay.  Why arenâ€™t I taken?  Am I not a good one?â€  â€œWho the hell is going to date me when I have kids?â€  â€œI canâ€™t give any more to someone elseâ€™s emotional needs.  I have to take care of myself.  How am I going to date?â€  â€œI need sex but I am totally unwilling to put up with any more of this dating crap to get it.â€  We may well be hardwired to reproduce, the ticking â€œbiological clock.â€  Men feel it as well as women.  In early sexually active years it manifests as the desire to have as much sex with as many people as possible.  Later, it becomes the aforementioned home-building desire.  Right when available and interesting women have very little interest in same.  God laughs as men start dating younger women because they are available, they do not have children yet, they are not married.  When women are ready to settle down again the men of similar age are taken.\r\n\r\nIf we have made it to our thirties single, bloodied but unbowed, ready for further punishment, still looking for that special someone with an open heart and mind, we must all be acting on the hardware and not the software.  The brain has to be secreting primal  chemicals which insist, â€œReproduce.  Reproduce.  Reproduce.â€  The rational and evolved part of the brain would never allow us to repeatedly put ourselves such a potentially harmful situation, in very much the same way that children learn that fire is incredibly painful if they hold their hands in it.  Emotional damage is just as painful and scarring as bodily damage, hence the incredible number of psychotherapists, counselors, and support groups.  We all admit that bad childhood experiences can seriously impair a person well into adulthood; why donâ€™t we admit that bad adult experiences are just as terrorizing?  In cases of violence or incredible stress, we do: post traumatic stress disorder.  We also need to allow post traumatic relationship disorder.\r\n\r\nSaturday night beckons.

Let us therefore note that any time the word Jell-O is used, the above definition is implied.  Let us also assume that Kraft has a sense of humor and fun.  Lastly, we would like to note that innovators in any field have their trademarked names fall into everyday usage to describe a product, e.g. Hoover, Kleenex, Xerox, or Jell-O.\r\n\r\nJell-O is a wonderful substance.  Slippery yet sticky, cold yet warming, firm yet yielding.  Most people â€œof a certain ageâ€ have a memory of a punk rock party complete with Barbie dolls in a vat of Jell-O.  Most people have tried the gooey intoxicant know as the Jell-O shooter.  Most people know about Jell-O wrestling, though perhaps far fewer have participated.\r\n\r\nWe here at Bitch Kitty Racing have often longed for our own private Jell-O bath.  Being the fun people we know you are, we thought you might like to join in and learn how to create a date night to remember.  \r\n\r\nThis recipe is for thirty-eight gallons of Jell-O which will set up at room temperature.  We would also like to point out that for the sake of authenticity we used Jell-O brand, lime flavor.  We used a real bathtub in a really tiny city apartment to make sure this all works in the real world.  Please excuse our English measurement system; the metric system is so easy we thought it might be condescending to use it.\r\n\r\nJell-O is little more than dyed sugar in suspension, \"sticks to bloody everything\":photos/?c=Jello&p=16, is very difficult to clean up once it dries, and will stain everything it touches including: skin, hair, the floors, the walls, the stove, the bathtub itself, etc.  This is a very messy business, so be prepared for immediate cleanup while the Jell-O is still wet.  In the tub, the Jell-O will dissolve by merely running hot water over it straight from the tap.  Out of the tub, ye Gods!\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"102\" class=\"image-left\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that  this article is for entertainment purposes only, and that anyone foolish enough to try this might actually die slowly and painfully from serious injuries, may break bones or crack skulls, rip tendons or ligaments, etc.  Seriously, Jell-O creates very slippery conditions, so be careful.\r\n\r\nBefore you begin, estimate how much powdered Jell-O you will need.  We estimated by swinging a dead cat around in the bathroom and dancing in circles backwards with a tape measure to arrive at the volume formula of: (length of tub) X (width of tub) X (depth of tub) = volume in cubic inches, then converted to gallons using chicken blood in a silver basin under a full moon.  1,000 cubic inches is about 4 1/3 gallons.  For the rest of the world, a simple conversion from cubic centimeters to liters will suffice.  24 ounces of powdered Jell-O makes one gallon of delicious dessert.  For this project we used slightly less water to result in a thicker product we hoped would set at room temperature.\r\n\r\nFor a forty gallon tub, we used:\r\n\r\n* Forty-four 24 ounce packages of Jell-O\r\n* Fifteen gallons of ice\r\n\r\nTo prepare the tub we poured in all fifteen gallons of ice, then added about five gallons of cold water. To this mixture we would add our Jell-O.  It was hoped that would could dissolve at least ten packets of Jell-O in one gallon of boiling water to keep the heat out of the mixture.\r\n\r\nWe used a large Dutch oven to boil one gallon of water, to which we added one packet.  We poured the mixture into a five gallon plastic bucket and stirred until dissolved, then noticed the mixture looked pretty thin. \r\n\r\nWe kept adding Jell-O until the mixture became like syrup, about twelve packets. The addition of more boiling water kept the sugary deliciousness from becoming granular, yet the heat dissipated rapidly. Before we added it to the tub we allowed it to cool enough to insert hands.  It had a consistency of exceptionally viscous syrup, but Jell-O will not set without cooling and time.  We poured that bucket of beautiful iridescent goo into the tub and stirred furiously.\r\n\r\nWe did this three more times until all the Jell-O was used and we had a total volume of about thirty-eight gallons.  We stirred and stirred to make sure the mixture was homogeneous.  The ice never fully melted.\r\n\r\nThe mixture reached itâ€™s final form in just over one hour.  It wasnâ€™t as firm as Jell-O that has been allowed to set in the fridge for four hours, but it was definitely firm enough for our purposes.  We skimmed off the ice and started to play.  The Jell-O is much colder than one might expect, though why an ice bath would seem unexpectedly cold is a bit of a mystery to us.  We then invited \"twenty of our closest friends\":photos/?c=Jello&p=3 and the Jell-O warmed up quite nicely.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto Shoot: \"Jell-O\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/galleries/jello/','147');

Itâ€™s cold and dark and wet about nine months a year.  In a normal year, the rain starts November first.  September and October are crisp and clean, frosty mornings and crunchy leaves.  Then Halloween, the greatest holiday of them all arrives.  No matter what time you go to bed that night itâ€™s starry and clear.  No matter what time you wake up the next morning chunks of rain are blowing almost horizontally into rotting vegetative matter.\r\n\r\nThe next time youâ€™ll see the sun is July 5.  No matter what time you unpack your wet picnic gear at home after the fireworks and go to bed, itâ€™s drizzly and cold.  No matter how early you wake up the next morning itâ€™s a cloudless 70 degrees.  Summer is why we all live here.  There are no jobs, housing is almost totally unaffordable, the traffic is now officially worse than L.A.â€™s, and every time you blink thereâ€™s another God damned Starbucks in place of your favorite coffee shop.  But the Summers are nice.\r\n\r\nSeattle has only the two seasons.  Summer and Crap.  Did I mention the darkness during Crap?  There are rain clouds six miles deep obscuring the sun, which is fine because daylight only lasts for six hours anyway.  Which is fine because the clouds actually extend below sea level, even raining on the oysters, so youâ€™d never really know if it was light.  To the average observer it varies from dark gray to darker gray, from a cold moldy sponge on the back of the neck to clammy hands of Death choking the hope from lives, depending on the time of day.\r\n\r\nIf it ever got down to actually raining it might be fun, but it never really does.  In Fall we do have enough actual rain for brief periods to cause flooding.  The Tolt, the Skookumchuk, the Stillaguamish, and the Snohomish rivers will flood on cue every year about November 15.  Every field along the 1-5 corridor will be a muddy windswept lake for months (the farmers here actually dredge cow-depth drainage channels through their fields at the beginning of the rainy season every year).  After that, itâ€™s pretty much like being a gynecologist for a goeduck; itâ€™s cold, itâ€™s wet, itâ€™s slimy, you have no idea where the water is coming from and you donâ€™t really care.  You just want to get out of there.  For eight months itâ€™s like this, always living on the inside of a cloud, rotting and slippery things underfoot, darker every day.\r\n\r\nOf course, all natives know that there is a possibility of snow at some point.  It wonâ€™t stick, it hasnâ€™t for years, but itâ€™s quite pleasant to look at in the late evening over a Baileyâ€™s and cocoa.  Until the next morning.   Then the entire city shuts down and every citizen who ventures out is in mortal peril of some idiot from Minnesota thinking he knows how to drive in the snow.  All natives know that Western Washington has two modes: uphill or under water.  Itâ€™s slippery enough going up the seven hills when itâ€™s merely wet.  When frozen, most of them are actually closed.  In case  you missed that, dear reader, if it ainâ€™t a hill itâ€™s wet.  We all live on one of the seven hills or on the water (or perhaps in a place where a hill used to be, or in a place where there once was water.  Itâ€™s very complicated).  Point being, native Seattleites (both of them) have very little practice driving in the snow and itâ€™s very hilly.  The hills are closed when it snows, so we donâ€™t drive in the snow.  Period.  Any of us.  Ask anyone.  But those Midwestern madmen are out and showing off and routinely running into stationary objects, such as busses and fallen pedestrians, because they seem to have all missed the â€œUphill or Underwater?â€ brochure we hand to all new residents to assist them a choosing a homesite.  \r\n\r\nSo, the terminally wet and never-ending darkness of the season of Crap is why Seattle is famous for coffee, beer, and industry.  We need to keep going.  We need to have lots of parties to keep our spirits up.  Grunge?  We were all very drunk, which is why you canâ€™t understand the lyrics.  Microsoft?  Of course we can all spend eighteen hours a day working in a cubicle; thereâ€™s no point in going outside.  Boeing?  Get me the hell out of here!  The 600 million dollar monorail project which never got off the ground?  Damn Redhook, again.\r\n\r\nSo many people find Western Washington to be a wonderland of outdoor activities.  To them I pose the question: where are you from?  The natives know that itâ€™s either cold, wet, and dark, or itâ€™s sunny.  If itâ€™s cold, wet, and dark weâ€™re not going outside.  If itâ€™s sunny weâ€™re not going hiking.  We havenâ€™t seen a bare shoulder in nine months and you want to take us into the woods?  Oh, no.  We know better.  Itâ€™s uphill or under water.  Scrambling up mud or squishing in a swamp.  The direct opposite of fun.  You people can have it, and thank you for paying us the additional visitorâ€™s tax we have on hotels and restaurants.  Skiing?  I think weâ€™re all cold enough, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nI can still see the red lights demarking the tops of the buildings downtown, yet it rains and blows.  Itâ€™s only October 1.  Somehow, Iâ€™ve been robbed.  One month early this year I have to stock up on Viognier and Sancerre, Pinot Noir and Cabernet.  I have had to take especial pains to ensure that my liver will survive another dark season, buy sweaters early, and stock up on heavy ingredients for stew and cassoulet.  I donâ€™t even have a pumpkin yet!\r\n\r\nThis is the dating season in Seattle, for those of you who donâ€™t live here.  Every Spring we all become single with the sights and smells of exposed flesh.  Every Fall we all are ready to start dating seriously again, with thoughts of rainy Sundays spent in bed.  Why go outside?  Itâ€™s nasty out!  Normally, if you havenâ€™t picked a mate by Halloween, expect to spend Christmas alone.  This year, with global warming and a sixth El Nino, what will happen to us all?  We were unprepared!  Strange.  I digress.\r\n\r\nGet a pet.  Get more friends.

There is a line in the movie Auntie Mame: â€œLife is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!â€  In order to help others feast at the table, Bitch Kitty Racing is planning a â€œbathtub filled with Jell-Oâ€ photo shoot.  \r\n\r\nIn order to produce a bathtub filled with jello many questions must be answered, but the main one is this: what color?  Ninety percent of the adult population polled will say green, but there are those who prefer red.  However, there is something about green that has an fun verbal ring to it.  Say it out loud: â€œI have a kiddie pool filled with lime jello.  Interested?â€  What a great date idea!  â€œI have a kiddie pool filled with cherry jelloâ€ somehow sounds, well, smokingly sexy.  Go to a mirror and see which word you look sexier saying, lime or cherry.\r\n\r\nTry it.\r\n\r\nYou see?  Spoken aloud, lime is fun and wrestling and kissing everywhere.  Cherry starts out that way but quickly escalates to right-there-on-the-kitchen-table, screaming and pounding sex, the kind that you giggle to yourself about all the next day.  Lime is naughty fun, cherry is bad fun.\r\n\r\nIt could also greatly depend on the gender of the person saying the word.  One would wager that a man saying either word in a mirror is thinking of a woman saying it to him, and a woman vice-versa (though it may also be that the same woman is thinking of seduction.  Men think of seduction, theyâ€™re just not very good at it.  Too eager).  Lime is fun, cherry is exciting.\r\n\r\nThe actual color is also a visual stimulant.  A woman in a red dress is thought of as racy.  Ferrari racing cars are usually red.  Blood and lipstick are red.  The heart is always portrayed as red.  A woman reaching reproductive age menstruates red.  The color red invigorates our pulse, causes our nostrils to flare slightly, increases the depth of our breath.  Green is for British sports cars, growth, life, viriditas.  We did not evolve as gatherers, but as scavengers, then hunters.  We respond gutturally to red, we want to kill it.  Sexually, red indicates readiness.  We respond gutturally to that as well.\r\n\r\nThe color choice for the magazine will be green to symbolize fun and life.  As the darkness of Winter rapidly approaches, we need more fun in our lives.  It might not be a bad idea to have a stock of cherry on hand at home, though, just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto Shoot: \"Jell-O\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/galleries/jello/\r\n\r\n','149');

We discussed case discounts and lead times for the ordering.  It  would take two days and cost $222, which was far over budget.\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"100\" class=\"image\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nOutside in the rain, I called the photographer, Shawn, and asked for advice.  â€œTry Grocery Outlet.  If they donâ€™t have it there weâ€™ll go to Costco.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhy donâ€™t we just go to Costco first?  Theyâ€™re more likely to have the quantity we need.  Iâ€™ll pick you up.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œSounds good.â€\r\n\r\nWe had to park the Mini as far away from everyone as possible in the lot to avoid door dings.  I am fanatical about some things, and my car is one of them.  In a place like Costco this usually means a forty minute walk carrying a GPS receiver to be able to find the car again.  Shawn loaded his camera out, because anything worth doing is worth having on film.\r\n\r\nI hate Costco.  It is a nightmare.  Twelve acre parking lots, ugly architecture, and a traffic disaster.  Worst of all, there is no customer service.  I have only been in Costco three times in my life because trekking around a cold warehouse with hard concrete floors looking for something in row after row of unmarked aisles avoiding construction machinery without a single person to ask for help is not my idea of a good time.\r\n\r\nExpectedly, we could not find what we were looking for and there was no one to ask.  I lost Shawn somewhere in the land of shiny bleeping things and became exceptionally mall-panicked.  My phone rang and I practically leapt through my pockets, desperate for some one to talk me down, talk me away from this 13th century Mohammedan bazaar.  However, instead of a stop on the Silk Road this was a stop on the Container Road; instead of miles of textiles being unloaded by mile-long camel trains there were millions of standardized shipping boxes disgorging millions of tons of commodity-grade plastic.\r\n\r\nI answered the phone: â€œGet me out of here.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOh, honey, where are you?â€  Corrine.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m in the middle of what looks to be the beginning of a race war.â€  Indeed, saris and turbans struggled with stadium jackets and baseball hats over the free tuna fish salad samples, carelessly spooned onto saltines by a dying Midwestern grandmother wielding a white plastic spoon.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhere are  you?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œCostco.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOh, Jesus.  What the hell are you doing there?â€\r\n\r\nI outlined the plan and the economic necessity of this excursion.\r\nâ€œDial information and have them connect you to Cash and Carry, tell them what you want.  Call Shawn and meet him at the exit.â€  This is what I needed.  An outside voice away from the sodium-lit shiny things.\r\n\r\nForty gallons of jello can be made from sixty pounds of dry mix, which I finally had in my possession in the trunk of the Cooper, with enough left over to experiment and play.  Four cases containing twelve 24-ounce bags each; 72 pounds of sticky, gelatinous goodness.  I felt like stopping and doing thigh-sized lines off the dashboard in a Tony Montana-esque frenzy of glucose, sucrose, and power.  All for a hundred dollar bill.\r\nâ€œOkay, ese, letâ€™s get some ice.â€\r\n\r\nI stopped by the restaurant to raid the freezer, loaded out twenty gallons of ice in clean, white, five-gallon buckets.  â€œWhat are you doing?â€ I heard no less than ten times.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m making jello,â€ I replied.\r\n\r\nâ€œHow much?!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m filling a bathtub with it.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOh my God, thatâ€™s so cool.  Iâ€™ve always wanted to dive into a bathtub filled with jello!  Can I come?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNo.  This is a photo shoot, not a rave.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat?â€\r\n\r\nI refused to explain.  It just doesnâ€™t work with some people.  They see a bit of flesh or meat and want to consume it in a masturbatory frenzy of self-gratification that lasts for only thirty seconds.  They feed the beast, but not the person.  \r\n\r\nIâ€™m certainly guilty of that.  \r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why God invented wine, nu?\r\n\r\n<txp:upm_image type=\"image\" image_id=\"108\" class=\"image-left\" show_title=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nOh, science!  Shawn and I are both engineering technicians; that is to say engineers make things up and we actually make _things._  The question before us now was what the final temperature of the water would be if we started with four gallons at 35 degrees and added one gallon at 210 degrees.\r\n\r\nâ€œDv over dx?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNo, sine of something.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œLook it up online.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat the hell does this mean?!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œGo to a different site.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œScrew it.  Boil the water, throw it in, and weâ€™ll see how hot it is.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDo you have a thermometer?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNaw.  Just stick your hand in it.â€\r\n\r\nWe began boiling the water and taking test photos, checking light and shadow, throwing ice around, drinking beer.  Corrine showed up and things began to take on a much less serious tone.  It was quickly discovered that the pretty girl looked much better on film than my honky self, so we used her extensively.\r\n\r\nâ€œRoll the bag so the logo doesnâ€™t show.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œLook over here.  No, there.  No, you were better before.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œMove this way.  No, back.  No, you were better before.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œOkay, pour.  Slower.  Wait.  No, go again.  Stop.  Wait.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWait, donâ€™t look at the camera, look at  me.  No, look at the camera.  No, wait, look at me.  No, you were better before.â€\r\n\r\nLuckily, Corinne had a sense of humor about the whole thing.  I personally would have punched myself.\r\n\r\nThe jello began to kick the moment we started to stir in the ice, reaching its final hardness in just under an hour.  Not nearly as firm as anticipated, but still retaining form when glopped on to the bottom of the bathtub, still sticky enough to cling to arms after testing the depth.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated with another round, toasted our good fortune, planned the final shoot and further crimes.  Sometimes the business of art is fun and those moments really need to be realized, because most of the time itâ€™s driving over the entire rainy city looking for the one thing I canâ€™t find but must have to make it all happen as planned.  That part is a frustrating compulsion, a feeling that the world will never be right unless I have this one little thing that never existed.  Itâ€™s always like having stitches removed; it hurts, but in a good way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto Shoot: \"Jell-O\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/galleries/jello/','150');

She was sleeping peacefully, snoring just a tiny bit.  I was surprised because I have no idea where she came from.  The last thing I remember was going to bed by myself.  Have I started picking up strange girls in my sleep?  Sleep dating?  I wasnâ€™t even drunk last night.\r\n\r\nI poked her gently and she opened up one big green eye, smiled, mewed softly, and rolled over on her back like she wanted a belly scratch.  I looked down at the end of the bed where my own overstuffed housecat sat watching me with his own big green eyes.  â€œPervert,â€ he seemed to be saying.  â€œNow I see why you had my balls cut off.  Less competition, eh?â€  I was flabbergasted.  He was allowing another cat to sleep on my pillow.  Heâ€™s very good with other animals, but this was a complete stranger.  I couldnâ€™t understand it.  Did I somehow do something unnatural last night?  Had I been in the catnip and wound up in a bi-species mÃ©nage a trios? \r\n\r\nI live on the second-and-a-half story of a brick apartment building.  The only way this cat could have gotten in was through the front door.  She had to have come in with me last night.  She was dark enough that maybe she could have slipped through my feet on the way into the unlit foyer unseen, but nothing explains the Pasha, my cat, not flipping out.  She was pretty cute, though . . .  \r\n\r\nâ€œYou gotta go,â€ I said to my interloper.  I picked up her tiny little body.  She was only about three pounds, merely a snack for my twenty-pound monster.  She totally relaxed and started purring.  No tags, no ID, no collar.  Great.  I walked her downstairs and out into the garden behind my building, set her down gently and watched her scamper off without so much as a wave goodbye.\r\nI hope I donâ€™t get fleas or anything.

We here at Bitch Kitty Racing express our deepest sympathy for you. We know how much it hurts.  To help you through this troubled and _temporary_ time, we have compiled a few real-world tips.  Theyâ€™re not painless, and theyâ€™re probably not on any Psychological Health Top Ten lists, but this is the real world.  Who the hell wants to get in touch with your inner child at a time like this?!\r\n\r\n_Psychologists schmycologists!_\r\n\r\nThese are in no particular order, so read them all.     \r\n\r\n* Eat.  Go to the corner deli and buy yourself some damned sandwiches.  Eat at least one a day, and it would be nice if you ate two.\r\n* Put on that horrendously ridiculous Blue Tooth headset that you bought but have been too embarrassed to wear in public because it makes you look like an idiot.  Call all your sympathetic friends and kvetch.  If anyone says: â€œI told you so,â€ hang up and never speak to that person again.  If anyone offers helpful advice hang up, but you may speak to them at some point in the future.  \r\n* Get a big box and place everything of your loverâ€™s in it, and also any memorabilia.  You do not need to be remembering that one weekend you spent together, mooning over pictures, or listening to the song you first danced to together.  Take that box and triple tape it shut, but donâ€™t throw it away!  Some items in it might be valuables youâ€™ll want later, and your loverâ€™s things can be used as a bargaining tool to get back yours.  Do take that box, though, and lock it in a dark corner in the basement or garage. Do not open it.  And in this digital age, make sure you clean your hard drive and burn all pictures and letters onto a DVD, but donâ€™t look at any!  Throw the DVD in the box.\r\n* Start cleaning.  Scour your home.  Get rid of any evidence at all that your lover existed, from anything you missed in you Loverâ€™s Stuff sweep to stray hairs and skin flakes.  Donâ€™t forget the bathroom cabinet because there are two toothbrushes in there.\r\n* Eat again.\r\n* Clean your bedroom thoroughly and make sure your bedding is fresh.  Make sure you have an adequate supply of condoms and lube in the nightstand â€“ youâ€™ve probably been drinking and talking to your friends: if they love you theyâ€™ll get you out of the house later and you have no judgment right now.  Yes, you will hate yourself in the morning.\r\n* Do not allow your lover into your house. Do not go to your loverâ€™s house.  These are the physical spaces where you explored your intimacy and all the feelings will flood back. \r\n* DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.  DO NOT engage in break-up sex.\r\n\r\n_Break-up sex drags out the pain and suffering of loss and is completely avoidable self-flagellation. It does more harm than good.  If you think you might engage in break-up sex, drag a cheese grater over your genitalia and imagine itâ€™s your heart.  You can live without sex, but you cannot live without a heart._\r\n\r\n*Eat again.\r\n\r\n* Exercising is great, even though itâ€™s probably next to impossible right now.  You need to improve your self-confidence and sense of accomplishment.  Though itâ€™s hard and seems pointless when your world has just ended and even the stars weep for you, you need a daily victory.  You also need to feel hot right now.  \r\n* Avoid like a rat-infested thirteenth century Paris any weepy music.  It might seem stupid to cry uncontrollably for days while listening to â€œIâ€™m Walking on Sunshineâ€ by Katrina and the Waves, but wallowing in your pain is stupider.  It also makes it easier to clean and exercise.\r\n* No matter what your lover did _to_ you or did not do _for_ you, forgive all transgressions.  The relationship is over.  Clean out your heart like you cleaned out your homeâ€”your heart _is_ your home.\r\n* If you are a previous smoker, make sure you have lots of nicotine gum around.  The last thing you need to do is start smoking again.  I suppose this goes for drug addicts as well.  By smoking, as well as some other drugs, your body is trying to raise its serotonin levels so you do not suffer from depression or sleep deprivation.  Go for walks, go to a tanning bed, exercise, create, clean, but do not revert to your previous addiction. Easier said than done, but now you know why you want to revert and hopefully you can avoid it.\r\n* Make a to-do list every morning, and keep it reasonable with simple tasks like cleaning the cat box or doing the dishes.  Make sure it is completed every night before you go to bed.  â€œWrite the Great American Novelâ€ is not a suitable entry on this to-do list.  Youâ€™ll feel better if you accomplish a task every single day.\r\n\r\nWhile by no means a cure-all, Bitch Kitty Racing hopes these tips help you through this difficult time.  We feel for you.  Hang in there!  The sense of grief and loss is temporary. You will feel better in time.\r\n\r\nAnd also remember, dear God and oh no, youâ€™re going to fall in love again!  \r\n\r\n\"_Get the Soundtrack to How to Break Up here_\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/bitch-kitty-records/imixes/how-to-break-up/\r\n','155');

Ninety-five percent of the time they are tyrannical, yelling, waiter-hating, drunken assholes.  \r\n\r\nNot to say that television chefs have no value; of course they do.  They entertain and teach.  I have been a fan of cooking shows for years, all the way back to Graham Kerr when he was still a drunk and Julia Child when she was still intelligible.  It was different back then.  The chefs then still had the flashy sets and clean hands, but they genuinely loved food and didn\'t have that plasticky attitude that seems so prevalent now.  They didn\'t have catch phrases and product lines.  The shows I\'ve watched recently are produced on an assembly line by people who are way too pretty to be real.  They don\'t even have any burn scars visible on their arms, the badge of the working kitchen professional.\r\n\r\nI do like Anthony Bourdain though, but what\'s not to like?  He doesn\'t have a cooking show, he has a show where he eats, gets drunk, and does exactly what he loves: eating and getting drunk.  It\'s honest, and he\'s a lucky guy.  We know he\'s a chef, but he never tells anyone what to do, never uses that patronizing, lecturing voice that says, \"You\'re totally ignorant of my Art.\"  He comes across as being a real human being, though somewhat confused and weathered.\r\n\r\nThen there\'s Nigella Lawson, whom I admit quite honestly makes my heart go pitter-pat.  I assure you, however, that her looks are only part of it.  Mostly it\'s the food, the warmth of the kitchen, her domestic goddess attitude.  She\'s warm and charming in a cold English kind of way, sexy and distant.  She gives the idea that she\'s reading the recipes out of a book, just like the rest of us, and sharing her tips and tricks to makes things go smoothly.  I want to sit in her kitchen and sip white wine all day, watching her cook.\r\n\r\nThe celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis has worked in two upscale professional kitchens in L.A. and is currently a private chef and caterer.  Yet, she\'s so tanned and toned and well made-up, so completely clean that she gives the impression of someone who has never had to work a day in her life.  Watching her puts my teeth on edge; she\'s so uptight!  She makes great food, but she looks fake and disdainful.  I want to take her out and get her ripped on Martinis, then start an argument with her, screaming at each other in the middle of the street with taxis whipping by, horns blaring.  I want to like her, I really do.  She needs to get back into a busy cramped kitchen and work saute for a few years, get back in the trenches and rid herself of the Princess Delicate Flower personality.  She\'s supposed to be an Italian.  Where\'s the heat?\r\n\r\nThe chefs I know in the real world aren\'t nearly so pretty.  The ones I\'ve worked for vary from the corporate jerk so concerned about profit margin he would throw away plates prepared by accident, a measure designed to discourage the staff from ordering dishes \"by accident\" to get a free meal; to the affable Said, former personal chef to Morocco\'s King Faissal.  Said would prepare a huge meal for us every day before the restaurant opened and we would sit down together like a family.  I would\'ve followed that guy to the ends of the Earth, but he sold out and moved on.  \r\n\r\nMy favorite chef may have been Armida, though.  She ruled her kitchen despotically, instilling respect through total competence in the kitchen and complete terror in the waitstaff.  She always looked like she was suppressing a smile as she tore up another retarded house cat (polite euphemism for \"waiter\") for screwing up yet another order or not knowing the slightest thing about the menu.  Yet she was always making jokes in her completely deadpan way, and was one of the warmest people I have ever worked for.  She just wanted things to be done \"a certain way,\" the right way, her way.  That I understand.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of bartenders, but as this is my show let\'s concentrate on me.  I am a tyrannical drunken asshole.  I like things a certain way.  I want my _mis en place_ to be perfectly prepared.  I don\'t want to be interrupted while I\'m with the guests by a retarded house cat asking me, \"What\'s in a gin and tonic?\"  I hate waiters.  God help the one who steps behind my bar, especially if I\'m busy.  God help the one who orders seven margaritas and then tells me, \"Oh, I didn\'t want those blended.\"  It\'s really easy to see why the kitchen staff is always on the verge of locking one of these little plate-chasing bastards in the freezer for the night.\r\n\r\nMy cocktail staff is different, however.  These are professional beverage servers.  They are used to dealing with drunks day in and day out, and making top dollar off it as well.  They do tend to be a bit screwier as human beings, but that\'s easily ignored when watching a twenty-two year-old girl who barely tops five feet berating a drunken football player to the point of tears because he just grabbed her ass.  I respect these girls.  They\'re exceptionally tough, and the ones who aren\'t don\'t make it through the first week.  Alcohol always puts the drinker right on the line between sex and violence.  These girls realize that and always defuse a situation before it happens.  There is no way I could be them and do their jobs.  The first idiot who asked for a body shot would get punched.\r\n\r\nOf course, the minute we\'re off work we\'re all human beings again, even the waiters.  We sit at our own bar and get drunk together; kitchen, floor, and bar.  We\'re work friends, and sometimes a lot more.  Restaurant industry workers are sexually notorious: usually someone is sleeping with or dating someone else on the staff or in another restaurant.  We have to; no one else works our hours.  It\'s almost impossible to date someone with a day job when we work weekends and don\'t get off until three a.m.\r\n\r\nThe cable channel with all the food shows should do one about us; burn scars, glass cuts, dirty clothes, impossible personalities, drunken coke binges, promiscuity and all.  It wouldn\'t be pretty, but I guarantee you it would be no fraud.  Or better than that: give us Giada for a week.  Put her in our kitchen and lives and film it.  That would be total entertainment.  Seeing her wasted at five o\'clock in the morning in the back booth of a speakeasy while a nineteen year-old busboy does a line off her neck would completely humanize her.  I can only imagine she would be the most famous television chef of all after that.  Imagine her memoirs then.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','157');

Yes, there are still a few left here, but they\'re really not all that personal.  The problem with writing nonfiction is that for you, the reader, it not only has to ring true, it has to actually BE true.  That level of intimacy scares me, to be perfectly honest, so I tend to avoid nonfiction personal narrative whenever I can._\r\n\r\n_\"Why do older men date younger women?\" is a real question from a reader (thank you for your confidence in me).

I have personal experience with the issue and could have over-intellectualized my reasons for a month of Sundays, but I think the real reasons lie in what I felt, not in what I thought.  So the only way to answer it fully, and to the best of my ability, was openly, honestly, and plainly.

Personal Observations on Dating a Younger Woman\r\n\r\nA little over a year ago I wrote \"Observations on Thirty-something Sexual Differences,\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/observations-on-differences/ a musing on single men and women of that age and how their needs seem to diverge.  In it I inadvertently slammed younger women a bit, but as I usually talk about things that are of interest to the single Gen X, it wasn\'t really an issue to me.  Besides, would a twenty-one year-old notice?\r\n\r\nI work in the restaurant industry and am surrounded by early twenty-somethings day in and day out; their lives and loves, their hopes and dreams, their unceasing drama.  I\'m supposed to have a handle on these people (whom I affectionately call my \"retarded house cats\"), and of course everyone is different.  Like Peter whom I respect so well, Aaron who always makes me laugh, Erin who always has a smile and an ear for me, and my beloved Lisa with the unbelievably foul mouth, quick wit, easy laugh, and razor-sharp takes on everyone and everything around her.  Some people are simply more mature than their years would belie.  Some people are simply more interesting than their years would belie\r\n\r\nThey\'re adorable!\r\n\r\nBut dating one of these kids?  Oh, _HELL_ no!  I\'m sorry, I love them, I really do, but their brains are not fully formed yet.  They haven\'t learned any impulse control.  Their morality is fuzzy.  They can justify anything.  They aren\'t worried about hurting other people yet because they haven\'t been hurt by other people yet.  They are pretty much obsessed with themselves, fashion, sex, drugs, and rock and roll--exactly like I was at that age.  They remind me daily how utterly excited I was at twenty-two about _absolutely everything._  \"I\'m in a band!  Look at my clothes!  I have a motorcycle!  I\'m writing the Great American Novel!  I\'m in love!  I HAD _SEEEEEXXXXX!!!!!\"_  There is no way I would ever want to get romantically involved with my twenty-two year-old self.\r\n\r\nI still have an interest in fashions and modern music, but Iâ€™m far more interested in following them than creating them these days.  I just watch my young coworkers and see what they\'re doing.  Sometimes I laugh at the resurgence of styles that occurred when I was in high-school, the renewed popularity of punk rock, mod haircuts, and all those ridiculous tattoos and piercings, like so many star-bellied sneeches! but not really.  These young people are doing what all young people everywhere do at that age: defining their own identities.  Who are they? What do they like?  What are the limits of their freedom?  What makes them different from everybody else?  It\'s an endless game of one-upmanship until the individual finds the security necessary to be an individual, to have nothing to prove.  That\'s why there is so much social rebellion in the late teens and early twenties, so much rejection of common culture and mores.   \"I\'m dangerouser than you,\" they seem to say.  \r\n\r\nI was completely relieved when I hit thirty and accepted the fact that I was a socially inept geek with a flair for irritating people.  It meant I could stop pretending to be this imaginary person I wanted to be and work on creating the personal world I always wanted.  So some more years passed and I finally became an adult.\r\n\r\nLast spring I went through one of those slow motion breakups that are really a lot more like a cartoon scene where Coyote gets his feet stuck in concrete and Road Runner leisurely mills him into a paste with a steam roller.  After the breakup I felt old for the first time in my life.  I realized that I probably will never have children.  Not that I ever wanted any, mind you, but the window of opportunity is almost over for me simply because a mentally and emotionally appropriate future spouse will probably be nearing the end of her safer and easier reproductive years.  Of course it\'s still possible, but not without increased risk.  \r\n\r\nPoint being, I had become aware that I had reached a stage in my life where my age was shutting down certain possibilities, and not just children.  For instance, I would probably never be a rock star.  I mean, really, who the hell wants to start a band and try to make it big at thirty-six?  I think I\'d rather just take a trip to Paris instead.  At this age, I know who I am and am comfortable in my own skin.  I am confident in my abilities, yet know my limitations.  Life may not be as exciting on a daily basis as it was when I was younger, but it sure is a lot more comfortable!\r\n\r\nThen I met \"Esther\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/snack-cakes/ and suddenly my life got _very_ interesting.  Suddenly, I was dating a younger woman, and it was exactly what I needed, it was simple and easy because I was able to keep my emotional distance.  Everyone knows that people want different things at different times in their lives, and everyone knows that a twenty-two year-old girl is not ready to settle down, and everyone knows that these affairs should be as brief as possible, and everyone knows that at the first sign of attachment you turn around, walk away, and don\'t look back.  I kept myself in check. I lived from day to day and took the relationship for what it was.  I enjoyed her company, I liked to listen to her prattle on, I came to appreciate her stance on life, I was fascinated by her exuberance and energy.  I adored her, but I certainly knew better than to give her my heart, especially at my age.\r\n\r\nEsther taught me a lot about the other side of the relationship, too; mostly that everything I thought I knew about what was going on was \"wrong.\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/snack-cakes-redux/\r\n\r\nThen, during a particularly romantic moment on a weekend getaway, my rational thought failed me and I told her I loved her for no other reason than it just so happened to be true.\r\n\r\nShe reacted like I just sold her into slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Oops.\":http://bitchkittyracing.com/articles/break/   \r\n\r\nA few weeks passed, my wounds began to scab over, and yesterday I was at a football party with people my own age, both men and women, mostly single.  It was at Annie\'s house overlooking the lake, BMW in the driveway, built-in wine cooler in the kitchen, all the things life rewards you with for being a little older.  I met a lot of new people, all very friendly and talkative, no doubt helped along by the mimosas.  \r\n\r\nAnnie asked me, \"So, whatâ€™s your status?\"\r\n\r\n\"Iâ€™m single,\" I said, still surprised by the word.  \r\n\r\n\"Oh, I\'m sorry, baby.\"  She petted me and kissed my forehead.  \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was twenty-two.\"  Suddenly four other guys were nodding at me with knowing looks on their faces and all the women were shaking their heads.\r\n\r\n\"What were you _thinking?!\"_ exclaimed Annie.  \r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don\'t know,\" I said.  \"I suppose I did it because I can.\"  (_I did it because I can._  Mark that last sentence, dear reader.  It\'s a piece of our puzzle.)\r\n\r\n\"I had one who lived in London,\" Carl said.  \"I spent a lot of time flying back and forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Age is just a number,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn\'t!\" I snapped.  \"Age is not something meaningless.  We change and we grow.  We\'re different every year.  We\'re supposed to know better.  We\'re supposed to make rational decisions based on experience.  I\'m almost forty, damn it!\" (Puzzle piece #2)\r\n\r\nSuddenly Dierdre interjected: \"How old do I look?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-two?\" I said, fudging a little.  Though ethnically Latin and utterly gorgeous, she really looked closer to thirty-seven.\r\n\r\n\"She just turned forty,\" whispered Annie in my ear.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious Dierdre felt old.  (#3.)\r\n\r\nThen the men overrode the women for a few minutes, and it came out that three of the four had also dated younger women in their mid-to-late thirties, and the fourth had a buddy who did.  It was agreed that it was hard to stop once it was started, that falling in love was inevitable, and that it was harder to get over than it should be. (#4)  \r\n\r\nI thought to myself, \"What does these girls give us?  We all know it\'s wrong and never going to work, but we do it anyway. It\'s like a drug!\" (#5)  Then I remembered two more of my friends who had dated a younger woman, fallen in love, and been hurt at love\'s end.  And as I write this I am reminded of my friends Wolf and Ignacio, both of whom actually _married_ their younger lovers before the relationship went South.\r\n\r\nHoly Crap!  Am I in a cult?\r\n\r\nNope.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fi%253D356381%2526id%253D356466%2526s%253D143441%2526partnerId%253D30\">\r\nGoodbye, Esther:  <img height=\"15\" width=\"61\" alt=\"Etta James - The Essential Etta James - One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)\" src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif\"></img>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nh3.  Solving the Puzzle\r\n\r\nWe\'re pushing forty, or perhaps a little beyond it. Jesus!  That\'s old!  At least it is to our younger mind.  We don\'t want to get old and let go of all the pleasures and excitements of youth.  We have not accepted our age yet.  We may be going, but we\'re doing it kicking and screaming, or at least punching a few walls as the bouncer carries us out.  In our older lovers we see fine lines around the eyes, a slight thickening of the waist, the skin starting to slacken on the neck.  We see ourselves in a mirror, and it scares us.  In our younger lovers we do not find youth, but _denial_ of age.  We cannot be young, but we can be ageless.\r\n\r\nIn our younger lovers we see how powerful we have become, or at least compared to men in their early twenties.  We don\'t look old yet.  We still have the potential to be in the best physical shape of our lives, and many of us maintain our bodies through exercise.  While we don\'t look youthful anymore, we do look like fully adult males of the species.  And as fully adult males, we also have the financial ability to spoil our lover rotten.  We give her presents, fancy meals, trips, clothes, anything we want.  Notice closely that I said, \"â€¦anything WE want.\"  What does she want?  We don\'t take that into consideration because this isn\'t about her, it\'s about us.  We are gorillas beating our chests and showing off, posturing.\r\n\r\nLet\'s also admit something embarrassing; young people are hot.  We can hem and haw and tiptoe around the subject, but men and women both like the look of young people.  The standard joke among my female friends about younger men is: \"He was hot until he talked, so I taught him something else to do with his mouth.\"  If a man said that he would be ostracized from polite, university-educated, politically correct society, but it doesn\'t change the fact that many men, and I think it would be safe to assume nearly all men, are sexually attracted to younger women, even the men who don\'t actually do anything about it.  Young women are attractive because they\'re physically young.  Rightly or wrongly, and no matter what anyone wants, and no matter what is fair or just, youth is a standard of beauty in our culture, especially for women.  While beauty does not increase a woman\'s value as a human being, it does increase her value to men as a mate.\r\n\r\nYounger women are also emotionally easier than women our own age.  Oh, dear God, it\'s all so simple!  There\'s no future and there\'s no past.  You just live in the moment, right here and right now, soaking up affection like you would soak up sun in Mexico after twenty years of a New York winter.  Neither of you expect it to last.  In fact, you\'re the only one thinking about where this is going at all.  You think to yourself, \"When I\'m fifty-two she\'ll be the age I am now.\"  You know damned well it\'s not going to work, but you can\'t give it up.  It is like a drug, a very lithe, smooth, sexually willing addiction on which you eventually become dependent.  Without it you will have to stare in a mirror forever and admit that you\'re getting old and that your kingdom can be taken away from you by a rival, for the simple reason than you are losing your physical power with every passing year.\r\n \r\nWe want them for another reason as well.  The odds of our seeing another youthful and gorgeous naked woman in our arms will get slimmer and slimmer as we age.  The younger woman becomes more and more desired as she becomes rarer and rarer in our lives.  Even just attention or light flirting makes us feel attractive and more manly.  I know several cocktail waitresses who use this fact to make more money, lots and lots more.  \"We could get this girl,\" is what weâ€™re thinking.  \"Weâ€™ve still got it!\" We eat it up, we suck it down, we bury our faces in the trough of it like pigs.  It\'s heavenly, it\'s intoxicating, it\'s cool spring rain washing the dirt from the wounds of a battered warrior after years away at the wars.  \r\n\r\n(Shut up, lady.  Stop laughing.  You asked me for an answer, and I am trying to give you one openly and honestly, and to the best of my ability.)\r\n\r\nWhen it goes awry, like it must, you feel old and foolish.  You should have known better.  It totally, completely, royally sucks and it\'s entirely your own fault.  You can\'t talk to your friends about it, because all they\'re going to say is, \"I told you so.\"  That\'s it.  That\'s all the sympathy you\'re going to get.  They don\'t know that you\'re not just letting go of your lover--youâ€™re letting go a portion of your life.  Or if they do know what you\'re going thorugh it\'s even worse: you get to hear the \"You Need to Face Facts and Grow Up\" speech.\r\n\r\n_Fuck you, not right now, thank you very much.  In fact, not ever!_\r\n\r\nOver beer and darts with Colin last night, who at the age of thirty-eight got his ass kicked by a lovely Italian girl of twenty-one, we compared our bruises and laughed together like two who\'ve survived a particulary fiery plane crash.  Oh, the lies we told ourselves, the lies we made ourselves believe, the sheer scale of the massive personal conspiracy we involved ourselves in to willingly and gleefully stay with someone that has absolutely no chance of living up to our expectations.  She couldn\'t!  She hasn\'t been alive long enough to know how!  The depth and emotional maturity that we have gained is the result of age.  How in God\'s name can we expect that in a younger woman when we didn\'t have it ourselves until five minutes ago?\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I asked Colin, \"What are we going to do when another one of our friends gets tangled up with a twenty-two year-old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Laugh,\" he said.  \"Buy \'em beer after.\"\r\n\r\nI cracked up.  \"You\'re an asshole,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Experience is the best teacher,\" said Colin.\r\n\r\n\"You\'re absolutely right,\" I said, suddenly serious.  \"I couldn\'t agree more.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fi%253D15224758%2526id%253D15224879%2526s%253D143441%2526partnerId%253D30\">\r\nThe Magnetic Fields: 69 Love Songs   <img height=\"15\" width=\"61\" alt=\"The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs\" src=\"http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif\"></img>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','158');

Let\'s get these items out of the way once and for all and let America know that we are beginning honestly.  I know the ladies and gentlemen of the press have allegations and questions they would like answered, so let\'s begin:\r\n\r\n# Yes, Mr. Moroney has tried drugs.  He found most of them to be quite pleasant.\r\n# No, The charges against Mr. Moroney from the Barnum, Bailey\'s, and Ringling Brothers Circus were never proven.  \r\n# Yes, Mr. Moroney did work as a dancer.  Yes, he was almost naked most of the time.  Yes, he will perform lap dances for campaign contributions.\r\n# No, Mr. Moroney is not an alcoholic.  He prefers to think of himself as a \"intoxication afficianado.\"\r\n# No, I\'m not sure why Mr. Moroney is spinning in circles while giggling and clapping his hands.  It\'s probably the amyls or the Martinis, it\'s hard to tell.  \r\n# Yes, there have been published picutes of Mr. Moroney drinking tequila from the navel of a scantily-clad twenty-two year old girl.  You should be so lucky.\r\n# No, Mr. Moroney is not connected to the Irish Mafia.  No such organization exists.  Mr. Murphy?  Will you take this gentleman into the anteroom and show him the diagrams?  Thank you.\r\n# No, Mr. Moroney does not have a fetish; he has several.  Undoubtedly would be willing to share and also indulge any of yours.\r\n# Whether he did or not, those acts were legal in that state at that time.\r\n# Will Mr. Moroney declare himself Dictator for Life upon election?  Sounds about right.\r\n# Yes, I\'m sure our administration has an exit strategy from Canada.  I mean Iraq.\r\n\r\nThat\'s all for now.  We will unveil our platform soon.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&offerid=50839.10000223&type=3&subid=0\" >$5&nbsp;off&nbsp;Stoli&nbsp;Vodka&nbsp;Martini&nbsp;Cocktail&nbsp;Set&nbsp;-&nbsp;8&nbsp;Pieces</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=9Nl7gDS2xmY&bids=50839.10000223&type=3&subid=0\" >\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-1192760-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>','161');

In order to get elected, they have to please a majority of the population, most of whom think all politicians are slimeballs and don\'t vote.  Until all state and federal congresses reform or end special interest lobbies, and until all state and federal congresses enact a one item per bill rule, politicians ARE slimeballs and have no choice to be otherwise.  They\'re criminals, actually: thieves and liars.  It\'s like a personality test.  \"Do you want a political office?  You do?

On top of that, you people are all so nice!  You\'re like Seattlites without all the flakiness and posing.  Send more Minneapoleans over here, or whatever you call yourselves.  We like them.  Hopefully more actual urbanites will displace the urban hipsters pouring in from the uglier suburbs and small towns of the less-attractive states.  On to your question:\r\n\r\nAh!  Mezcal, my Mejicana amor! My trusted confidante! My father confessor! My lover in times of loneliness!  Mezcal\'s creamy body and smoky silkiness wash over the tongue, always sipped, never slugged.  Let the passionless gringos thoughtlessly gulp their drinks like they thoughtlessly gulp everything else.  We of the hotter Latin blood savor our mezcal as we savor life.\r\n\r\nEnough of that.\r\n\r\nTequila is a distillate of the agave plant that is produced in the Tequila region of Jalisco, Mexico.  \"Tequila\" is a geographic designation in very much the same way the sparkling white wine will only rightly be called champagne if it\'s produced in the Champagne region of France, and bourbon will only rightly be called Bourbon if it\'s produced in a region where it\'s okay to marry your sister.  So tequila is a kind of mezcal, but not all mezcal cannot rightly be called tequila.\r\n\r\nSo Mezcal is tequila produced outside of Tequila.  Unlike tequila though, mezcal can be purchased _con gusano,_ with worm, or _con escorpion,_ with scorpion.  The worm is actually a flavor enhancing caterpillar that\'s been toasted util its legs are gone.  It imparts a mellow, smoky flavor to the liquor.  It isn\'t necessary, but it does add a nice note.  The scorpion is an utterly stupid marketing gimmick designed to make frat boys yell, \"Dude!  It\'s got a fuckin\' SCORPION in it!  Dude, that\'s motherfuckin\' GANGSTA! WHOOOO!\"  Perhaps they\'ll next package _mezcal con escorpion_ with a Girls Gone Wild video so the boys can make a complete night of it.\r\n\r\nInteresting historical coincidence: it\'s fairly common knowledge that tequila and mezcal are made from the agave plant, which is actually a kind of lily rather than a true cactus.  What is not so widely known is that that agave is named for mythological Queen of Thebes, Agave.  This is the cool part: Agave was a Maenad, a female worshipper of Dionysus.  Maenads were wild and uncontrollable women who indulged in sex, violence, and intoxication.  One would assume the plant was named after the discovery of mezcal, as drunken sex and violence are fairly normal results of a tequila high.\r\n\r\nOf course, it\'s the dose that makes the poison.  It\'s not so much that drinking mezcal makes people crazy, as the crazy way people drink mezcal.  They shoot it.  Shot and a beer.  Thereby consuming two drinks in the time it normally takes to consume one.  Of course they\'re drunk!  Of course they\'re going to have a tounge-shavingly perniciouos hangover in the morning.  But rather than slow down, the average mezcal drinker\'s skewed judgement thinks more mezcal is a good idea.  It isn\'t.  More mezcal will undoubtedly result in irascible behavior, bowing before porcelain idols, and missing pants.  If you\'re the dangerous sort and drink mezcal because it\'s a dangerous man\'s drink, remember that everyone around you associates leather pants with bears.\r\n\r\nA hint for enhancing the flavor of mezcal for the lick-shoot-squeeze crowd: sea salt.  Regular table salt is too salty and overloads the tastebuds.  Sea salt has a nice mellowness that brings out the nuances of the liquor.  It also mingles nicely with the natural flavor of your lover if you\'re going to do body shots.  Also, organic yellow limes, though ugly, have a sweetness that doesn\'t exist in chemically ripened fruit.\r\n\r\nEnjoy licking the salty goodness!\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n_Today\'s article is brought to you by Bitch Kitty Racing\'s choice for independent music:_\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2209890-10395161\" target=\"_top\">\r\n<img src=\"http://www.tqlkg.com/image-2209890-10395161\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n','164');

No matter what the good or service, we can always go next door and find the same good or service.  This creates a wonderfully competitive environment in which the customer has myriad choices for anything.  Don\'t like the way your car dealership is treating you?  Go next door.  Most cars are fabulous these days, and all will serve your needs.  Don\'t like the way your cell phone company totally ignored your needs after you\'ve been a loyal customer for eight years?  Go next door, I\'m sure they have similar phones and similar plans.\r\n\r\nThe backfire is that there seems to be something called \"industry standard\" out there, as in: \"Our customer service is industry standard.\"  So, Bitch Kitty Racing would like to ask those firms what is their competitive edge?  Why should anyone choose your product when you just admitted it is neither better nor worse than your competitor\'s?  Industry standard is a stupid sales pitch.  It\'s ridiculous to think that anyone would foster a business relationship with your firm when you have just promised to be the same as everyone else.  And to survive, you need relationships, not customers.\r\n\r\nIdiots.\r\n\r\nBitch Kitty Racing is here for you, the individual.  That is our competitive edge.  You may have noticed we\'ve begun answering questions.  We do that because they have interesting answers.  They are also a direct link to our readers, who accquire names and personalities.  There is another reason we answer questions: because you asked.\r\n\r\nThere is an old joke which is appropriate here:\r\n\r\nQ: What is the difference between God and a bartender?\r\n\r\nA: God doesn\'t think he\'s a bartender.\r\n\r\nAs fully half of our staff is a bartender, it is his right to know everything there is to know in the world, or at least have an opinion on it.  Do you have a question?  Ask!  Want to know how to make the perfect Martini?  Have a concern about dating strategy?  Want to know why a hydrogen fuel cell works?

This is the resource with which I started: [North American Motoring](http://www.northamericanmotoring.com/forums/showthread.php?t=86796)\r\n\r\nIf your dealer will not address the problem I suggest hooking up with an independent mechanic or speed shop in your area.  Your mechanic can set up any new equipment to feel just like stock, if you so desire.  Talk with him or her about your daily needs; that\'s the best place to set your car.  Be aware that with new suspension equipment you\'ve probably just blown your street stock classification for Solo competition.  That sucks, and I\'m sorry.  It was so nice to smoke the competition right out of the box with our superior automobiles, but now we have to find out how the other half lives.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to recommend any one system.  Your personal needs will dictate your fix.  I am looking at Dinan upgrades, but they\'re expensive.  I also do no use my Mini as a daily driver, but only as a luxury go-kart.  In Seattle, I will never tighten it down all the way.  There are far too many potholes here and I have no doubt I\'d hate the ride.  To be perfectly honest, the only time I\'ve really ever appreciated the ride at all was on track days.  On real roads, I cringe at every jounce, not for my kidneys, but because the car really seems to hate it.  Apparently, it does.\r\n\r\nStill, they\'re awesome cars.

It\'s hard, it really is.  Alcoholics, twenty-first birthdays, surrounded by drugs and booze, people with no morals, folks with no standards, a subcommunity of drunks with no hope for the future.  \r\n\r\nActually, it\'s kind of fun!\r\n\r\nOnce you get over the inital shock of the tawdriness, there is a never-ending supply of stories to watch, or stories to collect and tell.  My bar is not glitz or glam, it\'s just the neighborhood joint.  I mostly see the same faces day in and day out, but that\'s not without its perks.  Regulars always tip well, at least the ones I love.  \r\n\r\nBut how to survive it, if only for the final year of college?  If you work in this industry you will be sucked in at some point--there\'s no avoiding it.  You are surrounded by people who work your same bizarre hours, have your same interests, are doing the same things as you, and also like to party at four a.m.  The price is loss of reality and self.  You\'ll lose yourself if you don\'t move up or get out.  So how to survive?\r\n\r\nHere:\r\n\r\n*Leave work.*\r\n\r\nbq. Never drink in your own bar.  If you do so you\'ll develop intimate relationships with the staff and guests.  They\'ll know your business, and you\'ll know theirs.  When you show up for work the next day they\'ll be asking after your cat, or worse, your girlfriend.  You do not want this.  It violates the fourth wall rule: never look at the camera.  In this case, don\'t let the customers see into your soul.  Everyone views you as what they drunkenly want.  Don\'t give them reality and blow all their hopes and dreams.  Keep yourself separate.  It\'s a job, not your social life.\r\n\r\n*Do not fuck the customers.*\r\n\r\nbq. These people pay all your bills every month.  As a bartender (or cocktailer), it is your sworn duty to shill them for as much cash as possible.  If you fuck one, it\'s going to be at your bar the next day, inventing a reality in which you are not just a slutty bartender and they are not just a drunken make.  This person will expect some loyalty which you do not feel.  They will make a scene, guaranteed, be it big or small.  You will pay for your crime.  Remember, you flirt for a living.  Crossing the line means you\'ve cheated on the rest of your guests, and they will all find out and tip you less.  All your coworkers will also find out.  Everyone will know all your intimate details, down to the last mole, and they will share.\r\n\r\n*Do not fuck your coworkers.*\r\n\r\nbq. This one\'s next to impossible, but it is HIGHLY important for a healthy work environment.  If you fuck a coworker, you have to face your fuck day in and day out for as long as you both choose to work there.  If you liked your fuck you have to watch that person flirt with everything that moves, you have to not feel intimacy, nor show any affection, nor visibly twitch when they blow you off for someone else.  If you didn\'t like your fuck you now have a serious problem, because you just used someone for sex.  Congrats!  You now work with someone who knows you\'re a whore, and the entire staff is going to find out, and then the guests.  Again, everyone will know your personal details.\r\n\r\n*No one at that bar is your friend.*  \r\n\r\nbq. Keep your personal life out of your workplace, just like any other profession on the planet.  If you do that you\'ll have to maintain an outside support network, you\'ll have to have a life outside of work.  This is called \"healthy.\"  If your coworkers or guests are also your friends you will develop a dependency on your job for emotional support.  NO!  Bad you!  Your life, your hopes and dreams, your wants and needs all exist outside of your bar.  Keep it that way, and then your job is just a job, nothing more.\r\n\r\nIn short: if you worked in an engineering or law office instead of a bar, you would never expect it to be okay that your friends or lovers to sit on your desk for half of your shift.  It is never, ever okay that your friends or lovers sit at your bar for half your shift.  This is where you earn your living, nothing more.  It is a party, but you are paid to chaperone.  In this sue-happy climate, you need your full attention on your job.\r\n\r\nBesides, you flirt for a living.  Who wants to flirt with someone else in front of your treasured lover?\r\n\r\nKEEP YOUR PERSONAL LIFE OUT OF YOUR JOB.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2209890-10395161\" target=\"_top\">\r\n<img src=\"http://www.tqlkg.com/image-2209890-10395161\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n\r\n_Today\'s article is brought to you by Bitch Kitty Racing\'s choice for independent music._','167');

Kevin is doing all the things that need to get done to help spread the Bitch Kitty gospel, and gives Keith someone to talk to about Arts Technical without having to dumb it down.  There\'s so much to do all the time to manage this site.  Kevin is a much-needed addition and we are thankful for his help.\r\n\r\nWhat else?  Apparel is coming very soon.

Though common, apostrophe pluralization is wrong.  Because this is English, I can\'t say always, but I\'m more than certain that this is the case.  When in doubt, spell out the word, e.g. eighties.

Here  are some simple tips to get the viewer through your profile with a minimum of revulsion, snickering, and embarrassment.\r\n\r\n* If you can format your own page, please make sure it can be seen against your background.  Black on black is only good for goth clubs and formal dinners.\r\n* Everyone thinks they\'re funny.  Check with honest friends before posting this as  a strong character trait,  especially if you make a joke in your profile.\r\n* Everyone likes good movies and good food.  Who likes bad movies and bad food?  \r\n* So, you know how a woman should be treated. Um, isn\'t it the same way that every human being should be treated?\r\n* Please, your exact length in inches is supposed to be a surprise.\r\n* Everyone likes hanging with friends.  You don\'t need to list it unless you don\'t have any.  List that--it\'s noteworthy.\r\n* Posting a picture of yourself with a gun is not attractive--it\'s scary. \r\n* The word \"lady\" is a loaded term for many women.  I advise against using it.  \r\n* Any man who wants to date a woman of politesse and decorum should avoid the words \"classy lady\" at all costs.  \r\ndo you have one line about you, and six paragraphs about the person you are seeking?  Iâ€™m getting a clue here about why you might be single.\r\n* You want to spoil her? What do you think she is, a cocker spaniel? You spoil pets and maybe small children.  You respect other grown-ups.\r\n* Avoid using the word \"hate\" in referring to a person or people anywhere in profile.  \r\n* Oh, I did NOT need to see that! It\'s a profile, not a porn show.   \r\n* Yes, my friend, no doubt you would like someone with \"the brain of Janeane Garofalo and the body of Claudia Black.\" I would like someone with the brain of John Donne and the body of Ewan McGregor, but I realize it just isn\'t likely. At least I can spell their names correctly.\r\n* If you\'ll lie about your age, you\'ll lie about other things.  \r\n* Don\'t post a picture of your boat instead of a picture of yourself.  I\'m not going to a movie with your yacht, am I?\r\n* On the same topic, pictures of your house, your car, or your motorcycle instead pictures of yourself tell the world that you are a completely shallow ass without enough self-esteem to attract a mate based upon personality and character.\r\n* What does \"open-minded\" mean?  Does it mean \"I like frequent heavy bondage?\" or does it mean \"I voted for Nader?\"\r\n* You\'re not fooling anyone by posting a picture of yourself and someone else\'s kid.  Yeah, it\'s cute, but we all know what you\'re trying to do.\r\n* The profile song \"Bitches and Hos\" is not a big draw for women.','211');

INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('713','body','Textile','I\'ll admit it: I\'m a huge James Bond fan, as he was written by Ian Fleming.   \"Casino Royale\" was the first book in the series, published in 1953 (Fleming wrote 19 more Bond stories until his death in 1964).  It is more serious than the others, darker, grittier, yet is also portrays Bond at his most human; in love.\r\n\r\nThe newly released DVD \"Casino Royale\" is the best 007 movie released to date.  It is an actual film noir suspense thriller, and a damned good example of the genre.  It explains itself as such in the opening frames, a B&W sequence which portrays Bond getting his 00 designation while describing the cold ruthlessness of the Bond we are about to watch in the movie. \r\n\r\nFrom the gorgeous and utterly appropriate opening title sequence through the unhappy ending, this is not the same James Bond we have come to know and love over the last 40 years.  Daniel Craig portrays James Bond as a person completely capable of killing other human beings as the situation warrants, rather than just an action hero who kills because it\'s in the script.  There is no actor in the franchise\'s career that has ever let the audience contemplate the screwed-up psychology that allows a man to kill another man.\r\n\r\nThere is also the love story between Bond and Vesper Lynd, portrayed by the French actress Eva Green.  While perhaps not entirely believable as a treasury executive, the attraction and subsequent relationship that develops between Bond and Lynd is completely believable, from the distaste at the beginning to the obsession at the end.  Vesper Lynd is equally as insane as James Bond, and it\'s beautiful to watch, brilliance on the part of the writers, actors, and directors.\r\n\r\nThere is one gripe I do have with the filmmakers though, and not just to show that I am not in the studio\'s pay: the scene where a ruffled and defeated James Bond voices no preference for shaking or stirring a Martini.  Yes, I understand that this is Bond\'s first mission and that this one plays a major part in his psychological development, or that the filmmakers are really trying to break the Bond movie mold by screaming to the world the Bond is only human, and who would care about a cocktail\'s preparation after such a beating?  However, you do not do that in the 007 franchise, you do not thumb your nose at 40 years of tradition.  It should have been left out, because an entire world of James Bond fans got shocked out of the James Bond world for a moment, breaking the suspension of disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe cars, however, show that the filmmakers respected tradition.  There is the 1964 Aston Martin DB5, referred to by it\'s complete title by Bond early in the film, that made it\'s first appearance in 1964\'s \"Goldfinger.\"  The new Bond car?  An Aston Martin DBS (a 2008 model).  Pure car porn.  There is also something else that is James Bond automotive tradition: Ford.  It\'s true.  In \"Thunderball\" (1966), Ford provided all the cars, and so there is the memorable scene of James Bond being visibly shaken by being Fiona Volpe\'s passenger in a Mustang at 100 mph (of course, anyone who\'s ever been in a 1965 Mustang at 100 mph understands Mr. Bond\'s apprehension).  In \"Casino Royale,\" Monsiuer Bond arrives at the hotel in a Ford Modeo, the most plebian of European passenger cars.  It is a nod to tradition however, and we must accept it, as Aston Martin is also in the Ford family of fine products, as are Land Rover and Jaguar, the other two makes in \"Casino Royal.\"  If the viewer can choke down this bit of too-much-in-your-face product placement, there is thankfully enough very little else (but there is some), much appreciated in any new Hollywood movie.\r\n\r\n\"Casino Royal\" runs almost two and a half hours, and I still started the disc back at the beginning when it was over.  This is not just a movie for Bond fans--it is a movie for movie fans.','213');

Easy to understand.  If you knock the other guy down, so much the better.  He canâ€™t hit you any more.  You win.  At no point in boxing do the combatants ask the judges whose shorts look prettier, or who has the better hair.  \r\n\r\nRacing is the same.  Simple. Easy to understand.  Cross the finish line first.  In 1895, two guys in Chicago bet each other a beer on who could make it to the next bar first.  They slapped together some rules, found a sponsor, and modern racing was born.  Competition has taken on many respectable forms since then, but it all comes down to one simple thing: who is faster.  Thatâ€™s it.  Endurance racing, the ironman competition of the automotive world, still requires the driver to be faster than the others.  How far the car can go in a given amount of time is dictated by the speed of the car.  \r\n\r\nRacing is not ice dancing or competitive tango.  The tires need to stay hooked to the ground and pointed in the right direction.  Rally drivers who slide the car sideways in preparation for a turn are aiming the car at the turnâ€™s exit.  They do not ask the stewards if it was cool.  Their performance is not judged on esthetics.  They do not drive for style points.  They do not expect anyone to take them seriously for spastically flailing around corners, ruining tires and scrubbing off speed.  \r\n\r\nDrifting was born of the bad boys of Japan, punk kids who took off their mufflers and made as much noise and trouble as possible.  Itâ€™s a method of puffing up, itâ€™s a method of showing off, itâ€™s a method of being obnoxious, but even I will admit that it takes preparation and skill to keep out of the kitty litter while sliding sideways at seventy miles per hour.  If the style judges were removed and the eventâ€™s results solely based on speedometers and accelerometers, it would be a far more legitimate form of motorsport.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go dancing with your car, paint it pink and slap a tutu on it.  If you want to be judged on style, become anorexic and be a fashion model. Racing is an *objective* sport, with the object being to cross the finish line first.  The *subject* of how pretty you looked doing it is best left to your mom.\r\n\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)\">Drift Racing Wiki</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href = \"http://www.d1gp.com/\">Home to the Official Drift Racing Grand Prix USA</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n','247');
INSERT INTO `page_parts` (`id`,`name`,`filter_id`,`content`,`page_id`) VALUES ('802','body','Markdown','It is an unfortunate fact of life that some people donâ€™t beat their children enough to avoid those children growing into car prowlers.  Car prowling is also not usually very highly punished because the value of the items stolen is not very high, and it is highly unlikely that the prowler will be caught at all.  These thieving little bastards can be defeated, though, and all it takes is a change in thinking.\r\n\r\nFirstly, understand that your car is not safe anywhere, not even in a locked garage filled with pit bulls and snipers.  Leaving your car unattended for any length of time is like walking out on your drunk girlfriend during a roofie-eating contest at a frat party.  You have no control over what happens when youâ€™re not there.  None.  With that in mind, remember that car prowlers are opportunists; do not give them the opportunity.\r\n\r\n**Avoiding Car Prowlers**\r\n\r\n*Your bad attitude does not protect your car.*\r\n\r\nSeriously, there is an entire legion of otherwise rational people out there who think the fact that they are bad-asses is some sort of crime prevention system.  Thatâ€™s just foolish.  Your average car prowler is an opportunist and has no idea who you are, or that you own a gun, or that you would shoot him on sight if you caught him breaking into your vehicle.  In far less time than it takes you to pee, the car prowler has already smashed your window and gotten away.\r\n\r\n*Your unattended vehicle is not even safe for ten seconds.*\r\n\r\nTry this: time yourself breaking into an imaginary car with an imaginary rock.  Rock above your head, through the window, reach in, grab the backpack, run away.  How long did that take you? Seven seconds?  Four?  Youâ€™ll never see him. \r\n\r\n*Your car is not a safe--donâ€™t leave ANYTHING in it.*\r\n \r\nNothing.  Not a single scrap of paper, a leaky pen, a hamburger wrapper or an old coffee cup.  If you must have blankets in the car, leave them in the trunk.  Do not leave CD folders in view, your iPod plugged in the stereo, the removable face plate on your stereo, etc.  The car needs to be clean enough so anyone peering through the window will see nothing to steal. It needs to be clean enough so there is nothing in it at all. Not even car prowlers will smash a window for absolutely no reason.  Donâ€™t give them a reason.\r\n\r\n*If you can leave your glovebox open without draining your battery, do so.*\r\n \r\nEmpty the glovebox first, of course.  Again, show the thieves that there is no reason to break into the car.  Try removing the lightbulb to avoid draining the battery(check with a qualified mechanic if you have doubts).  Keep registration and insurance papers someplace else, accessible but out of sight.  Your personal information is on those papers, and that can be stolen, too.\r\n\r\n*Donâ€™t get an aftermarket stereo.*\r\n\r\nAftermarket stereos sound better than the one that came with the car.  Itâ€™s why we buy them. Itâ€™s also why your window gets smashed and your dash gets ripped apart.  If you are buying a new car, get a sound system upgrade at that time (try having it thrown in as part of your bargaining).  If you must buy an aftermarket stereo, remember that the cash you just sent is basically sitting on your dash in plan view, so take the faceplate with you every time.\r\n\r\n*Do not EVER give your address to an aftermarket parts store!*\r\n\r\nThere are people in the installation bay who use that information to go to your house and steal back the pretty parts they just installed.  They know exactly whatâ€™s in your car, and they know within fifty feet of where your car is probably going to be.  The mere information of your stereo brand and address can be bought and sold on the street.\r\n  \r\nDO NOT EVER give your address to ANY store for any reason.  They are flat-out lying if they say they need it for the return policy.  You have a receipt and thatâ€™s all you need.  If they wonâ€™t sell to you, go to someone who will.  This is the age of information theft, and all police departments frown out giving out personal information to complete strangers.\r\n\r\n*Park in well-lit and populated areas.*\r\n\r\nYour car is less likely to be broken into if there are witnesses.  Also, donâ€™t leave your car overnight next to a park or wooded area.  There are two examples in my neighborhood of high prowl areas: both are dark, rarely travelled, afford good getaway cover in parks, and also next to the freeway to cover up noise.\r\n\r\n*If you have a convertible...*\r\n\r\nAnyone who is even remotely serious about getting in your car can do so with something as simple as a sharpened spork, so be realistic. The cost of your soft top will probably outweigh the cost of any damage to your interior, sad but true, so the conventional wisdom usually states that you leave your car unlocked.  Check with your local law enforcement agency before making that decision.\r\n  \r\nSo thatâ€™s a start, anyway.  Donâ€™t unintentionally make your car a target.  Donâ€™t leave anything in it of value, or leave anything in it at all.  Donâ€™t tell strangers whatâ€™s in your car and where itâ€™s likely to be parked.  Donâ€™t leave your car in an area where no one would see or notice a crime.  Donâ€™t be a target.\r\n\r\nAnd if you happen to catch a car prowler, please kick him once for me.','249');

Day 0, Thursday\r\n\r\nThe airport freeway was a crowded mess of Frankenstein surfaces and lanes.  The blaring Xenon construction lights shone through the construction dust, mercilessly exposing every paint flaw in the traffic surrounding me as we milled towards the parking garages and pick up lanes of the airport.  I was here to pick up Keith.  He had flown in for a photo shoot that I hadn\'t the nerve to tell him had never really congealed, never really worked out, fell at a bad time, occurred under a bad sign, whatever. \r\n\r\n<r:asset name=\"DSC00151.JPG\">\r\n<r:link size=\"display\" rel=\"lightbox\"><r:image size=\"thumbnail\" /></r:link>\r\n</r:asset>\r\n\r\nI was late, but so was the plane.  I stood in the seven square feet of waiting area, all that is allowed by the anti-terrorist, jingoistic McCarthyites that have overrun the country, those who seem to have completely missed the fact that while massive inconvenience is certainly preferable to being bombed, it is a kind victory for those we are trying to defeat; we live in fear.  Weâ€™re Americans, though, and we forget every five minutes what it is weâ€™re supposed to be afraid of, until another byte of video sends shivers down our outraged spines.\r\n\r\n<r:asset name=\"seattle-200704-6903x.jpg\">\r\n<r:link rel=\"lightbox\"><r:image size=\"thumbnail\" /></r:link>\r\n</r:asset>\r\n\r\nMr. Bingman emerged from the tunnel.  Greetings were voiced, the requisite and uncomfortable man-hug exchanged.  What is it about the man-hug that is so odd?  Even among old friends, it can be a social nightmare.  Especially among old friends.  With anyone not known for at least twenty years, a handshake conveys all the meaning that is required, but with close friends and long absences, the immediate reaction upon recognition is a bear hug.  Alas, anything other than the handshake is simply awkward.  Itâ€™s not homophobia that ruins the man-hug; itâ€™s the rigid social code of white, middle class, university-educated America.    \r\n\r\nAlways sensitive to necessary niceties, I welcomed my old friend back to the Empire in the warmest way that men can: â€œBeer?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œBeer.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

One pint had turned into two at the first pub, then there were two more at the bar with the really cute cocktail waitress down the street, then there was this restaurant had no food but did have this weird Italian beer, then there was that place that was doing karaoke so we had only had a quick one before running screaming out into the night, then there was this sidewalk hotdog stand that served cans of domestic lager under the sunny warmth of an overhead heat lamp...\r\n\r\nSo much for my promise to Keithâ€™s wife to make sure he didnâ€™t drink too much.  \r\n\r\n<r:asset name=\"seattle-200704-6945x.jpg\">\r\n<r:link rel=\"lightbox\"><r:image size=\"thumbnail\" /></r:link>\r\n</r:asset>\r\n\r\nKeithâ€™s stupid jet-lagged ass woke up way too fucking early, and so of course I had to get up, too.  I got on the IM while the coffee brewed and chatted with Marie, our production manager.  Friday means only one thing: Friday Afternoon Happy Hour, the finest of Bitch Kitty traditions.  Every Friday afternoon Marie and I find a new place to watch people, be bourgeois, munch on plates petit, and gossip over something deliciously alcoholic between the hours of 5 and 7.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhere to?â€ asked Marie onscreen.\r\n\r\nâ€œKeith!  Wanna do Le Pichet?â€  I asked.\r\n\r\nâ€œSure.  Whatâ€™s Le Pichet?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œFucking tourists!â€ I chided Keith.  I let Marie know and then IMed Kevin.\r\n\r\nâ€œLe Pichet 4â€  Itâ€™s all I have to write.  Kevin knows what Iâ€™m talking about.\r\n\r\nâ€œK,â€ confirmed Kevin.  \r\n\r\nGod, I love the modern world.  How the bloody hell did we get anything done when we had to go through all that ridiculous phone voice-to-voice crap?!  Itâ€™s so much easier these days!  \r\n\r\n_\"Well gee, Jim.  Sally and I were thinking of having a quick martooni after work today.  Would you like to join us?\"_\r\n\r\n_â€œThatâ€™d be great, Frank!  Where are you two meeting?â€_\r\n\r\n_â€œIâ€™ll ring Sally and call you back.â€_\r\n\r\n_â€œThat sounds great, Frank.  Iâ€™ll wait to hear from you.â€_\r\n\r\n_â€œBye, Jim.â€_\r\n\r\n_â€œBye, Frank.â€_\r\n\r\nAs the kids say, what the fuck?  Now call Sally, if sheâ€™s even available, then call Frank back.  Countless wasted minutes, not seconds, bloodily torn from the bottom line of our company, _my_ company, while merely trying to plan a after hours social function. The older generation always bitches that we waste so much time online, emailing, or IMing.  Jesus, Grandpa, we can accomplish more in five minutes than you can all day.  Get with the program.  The bosses and accountants of the world should allot every worker ten minutes an hour for electronic personal time.  Hiding e-time from employers wastes more time than it takes to have it.  Trying to prevent e-time wastes more time than it takes to allow it.  Why lie anymore?  Join the modern world.  Itâ€™d boost morale and the firm would save millions in the costs accrued in trying to make sure no one gets on MySpace at work.    \r\n\r\nBitch Kitty Racing is founded on e-time.  Keith and I live ten thousand miles apart.  Kevin joined the company at the beginning of this year and has never met Keith in person, yet we have all managed to get along an do what needs to be done.  Face time is great for salespeople, but I think it makes everyone else nervous.  In brick-and-mortar reality, everyone who wants to see your actual face rather than your avatar wants something from you, like your boss who wants to yell at you in person, or someone you met online who wants to have sex with you.  Scary.\r\n\r\n<r:asset name=\"seattle-200704-6934x.jpg\">\r\n<r:link rel=\"lightbox\"><r:image size=\"thumbnail\" /></r:link>\r\n</r:asset>\r\n\r\nEventually, after the coffee balanced out our hangovers, we wandered down the hill to the Pike Place Market and Le Pichet.   After the usual spiel from the hostess about leaving soon to make room for the reservations (theyâ€™re not in Paris, but sometimes they do cop the attitude), Keith and I ordered a pichet of Bourgogne Blanc and waited for Kevin and Marie.    \r\n\r\nBy the time Kevin showed up we were well on our way...  So it came to pass that the first social meeting of the Bitch Kitty hivemind took place in a pretentious French cafe while high on wine.

After a year of wrenching soul searching, I know what I want: a 1999 BMW M3 Kombi.  \r\n\r\n_\"Did you just say you wanted a station wagon?\"_\r\n\r\nYes, yes I did.  \r\n\r\n_\"Really.  So tell me: how long have you been retarded?\"_\r\n\r\nNo, wait! Dude!  Seriously!  Think about it!  If a come-fuck-me red Ferrari blows your doors off, you think, \"Of course.  It\'s a Ferrari.\"  But if a navy blue family truckster leaps off the line in a fit of flaming smoke and fury, you\'re going to be confused.  Very, very confused.  You\'ll never win!  It\'s a sucker punch!  It\'s hysterical!  Super-duper go-fast with all the glorious utility of a Subaru wagon.  I wonder if I can make it all-wheel drive?\r\n\r\nOf course, oh my auto-geek brothers and sisters, as you already know, they never made a M3 wagon.  Isn\'t that great?!  Frankenstein never had it so good!\r\n\r\n_\"Why a 1999?\"_\r\n\r\n<img src = \"http://images.automotive.com/reviews/images/01bmw3series.jpg\">*{color:orange}_Cutiepants McGee!_*\r\n\r\nGood question!  Cheaper to buy, cheaper source materials, and in my mind the 1999 model year was one of the last years that BMW looked like, well, BMW.  Don\'t get me wrong, I am a huge Chris Bangle fan.  A Bangle BMW looks like nothing else on Earth, and the designs made the brand utterly distinct and have been aped the world over.  I have nothing but the highest respect for flame surfacing.

While certainly another go-fast masterpiece, I find that I must ask a rather silly and pointless question from a popular song by Amy Winehouse about the car\'s looks: what kind of fuckery is this?  Seriously, is it a Honda Civic EX Sedan or is it a Subaru Impreza?  I understand fully that the bump on the hood is undoubtedly to allow clearance for the naughty bits, but given that the car looks like a Japanese coupe, it looks like a a WRX reference.\r\n\r\nOkay, I\'m done.

It was also normal to hear the guest ask for a vodka Martini.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, a Martini is simply any cocktail served in a Martini glass.  Yes, the purists shout, grumble, flap their hands above their heads, gnash their teeth, and waddle about in small circles, but that is the situation today.  The Martini is almost certainly a fruit-flavored vodka muddled with more fruit and/or sweet herbs to cover up the taste of the alcohol, perhaps with sugar added.  Yes, you can hear my teeth gnashing, but being in the business means I accept as a viable reality whatever the guest wants.  \r\n\r\nBut I am not twenty-two.  When I order a Martini I expect the waitress to know that I mean only chilled vodka served up--and I do expect her to ask me whether I\'d prefer an olive or a twist--for that is the modern classic Martini: chilled vodka, no vermouth.  Being a purist, though, I often experiment with the vermouth portion of the cocktail, going back to nineteenth century basics with a sweet wine such as Sauternes or Moscato, or even using actual vermouth!  Gin also has it\'s lovely uses, bitter and savory being perhaps tastes acquired as an adult.  \r\n\r\nAbout a decade ago, I had a guy come into my bar and proclaim loudly that he was a New York City bartender. He was not only a bartender, but also a _bona fide_ prick (furthering my belief that, like cats, bartenders generally don\'t like other bartenders).  He did, however, teach me one of the greatest classic Martini variations, one that he claims Frank Sinatra ordered in his bar on numerous occasions.  Sinatra walks on water in my book, so I can only hope that this asshole was kind to him in his later years.\r\n\r\nh3. Martini Sinatra\r\n\r\nTo a shaker filled with ice, add:\r\nbq.  \r\n* one big shot of vermouth\r\n* dash bitters\r\n\r\nShake until frost forms on the outside of the shaker, then strain completely, discarding the mixture but retaining the vermouth-and-bitters-washed ice.  Over the coated ice, add:\r\nbq.  \r\n* two shots of ultra-premium vodka\r\n\r\nShake it again until a thin coating of frost appears on the outside of the metal shaker.  Strain into a Martini glass (obviously) and garnish with a lemon twist.  \r\n_Voila!_  Now now drink the night away while applying the term \"broad\" to every woman in the room.  Be sure to call the waitress \"baby.\"\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n','264');

Upon leaving, I couldn\'t help but notice that there was one half inch of ice on every road above Fifteenth, the three hundred foot altitude marker.  I crept onto Thomas and crossed Fifteenth, heading West.  I gunned the engine and shot through the intersection on the green, supercharger roaring.  Midway up the block, in front of the emergency drop-off, I grabbed the e-brake and pulled like a thirteen year-old virgin.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our lives, my pretty yellow baby spun on command, rear end slinging out in a perfect 180.  She spun, then she grabbed as I goosed throttle; perfect balance.  I couldn\'t been have been more proud of my darling.

You\'re talking to my ass; do you really want my ass to answer?\r\n# If someone is telling me a pointless story, don\'t get impatient with ME--I\'m not the one telling the story!  I\'m simply listening because it\'s polite, and people tip me when I\'m polite.  \r\n# Do not get impatient when a pretty girl is flirting with me.  Yes, it may take an extra minute to get your drink, but I guarantee you I\'ll be in a much better mood than if you  rudely interrupt one of the few joys of getting people drunk for a living.\r\n# Never start off an order by saying, \"You got ... ?\"  Most bars probably stock both Stoli and Jameson; you\'re not really asking for the moon here.  Ask for what you want, and have an alternate in mind, just in case.  \r\n# It\'s completely unnecessary to jump into every conversation around you if you\'re alone.  It actually makes everyone around you want to kill you in a most unpleasant fashion.\r\n# Never tell me you\'ll \"tip me fat\" if I \"hook you up.\"  If you tipped well, you wouldn\'t need to ask for generous pours.\r\n# Standing at an empty bar does not actually make you first in line.  The bartender is making drinks for EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.  \r\n# If there\'s table service available, wait for the server at the table--don\'t order from the bar.  It actually slows things down quite a bit for everyone. \r\n# Don\'t ask the bartender for his name.  The last thing anyone in the service industry wants is some jack-off calling his name every twenty seconds and thinking the \"personal touch\" warrants extra attention.\r\n# The smoking area provided outdoors is for tobacco, not pot.  Pot is illegal and the bar can be closed down because you are an impatient stoner.  Do not expect the bar staff to be polite to you about your drug use.\r\n# Do your coke somewhere else, or do it discreetly enough that no one sees you.  The bar staff is REQUIRED to react to illegal drugs on premises.\r\n# And please, for the love of God, don\'t wander into a bar in the depths of depression and play all the sad songs on the jukebox.

I said it\'ll happen, so it\'ll happen.\"\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t occur to me at time that what he was asking was this: \"What is your plan for failure?\"\r\n\r\n******************************\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that my simply saying, \"It\'s going to happen because I said so,\" might not be enough of an explanation for most people.  So, for the sake of the Bitch Kitty Racing crew an all the people who have invested and may in the future invest large sums of time and money in me, let me break this down for you.\r\n\r\n******************************\r\n\r\nWhen the New York Giants took the field last Sunday, the last thing they had was a plan for failure.  There was not a member of the team who was planning what to say to his mother when his team lost.  No, they had a vision of winning; they had a large goal made of smaller goals; they had a planned strategy.\r\n\r\nThey planned to succeed.  \r\n\r\nWhen I have a vision of a finished work, I break in into component parts.  \"I need so many props, this many sets, that many actors, these people to run the equipment,\" I say.  \"I need money to pay for it.  I need time to edit it.  I need a machine and software to edit it on.\"  And then I get work gathering everything I need, setting aside the time, asking for help from those who can offer it, and then the creation begins.\r\n\r\nThere is always the \"reality of the situation\" to consider.  When I started Casket Girls, I had no idea how large of a project it was and what it entailed.  All the big talk in the world did not prepare me for the reality of making my first film.  It was overwhelming, and I became discouraged.  However, I did not give up: I drew upon personal experience to guide me.\r\n\r\nLet me explain: the first time I went to the gym, I attempted an unassisted pull-up (some sort of close-handed variety that keeps the elbows parallel rather than perpendicular).  I could not lift my own body weight--I couldn\'t even do one pull-up.\r\n\r\nScrew that.  I wanted to do one simple pull-up.  Is that too much to ask?\r\n\r\nLuckily enough, my friend and trainer was there.  She put me through a simple program to strengthen the muscles that allow pull-ups, not by lifting the whole 180 pounds at once, but in smaller amounts that allowed all the muscle groups to become strong enough to enable me to lift the entire mass of my 37 year-old behind.  Finally, I got strong enough to lift my own weight.  Then, having accomplished one, I continued weights and the one until I could do two.  Then more building until I could do five.\r\n\r\nThis is important: when I could do five pull-ups, doing one pull-up was easy.  The impossible task was beaten, because my muscles had learned enough to do more.  (Now fifteen is a pain in the ass, so I make myself do twenty.  By next Friday, fifteen will be easier).\r\n\r\nThis applies to Casket Girls like so: when I finally realized I had no idea what I was doing, I DIDN\'T QUIT.  I set myself to learn more about all the processes involved.  It\'s simple, really.  When a problem seems huge, break it into its component parts, i.e. smaller problems.  \r\n\r\nWhen Sir Edmund Hilary set about to tackle Mt. Everest, I assure you he didn\'t jump.  He took one step at a time, all the way up.  He had to plan the steps, see which ones he couldn\'t take and work around them.  He even had to plan the taking of the steps, and plan even how to plan the taking of the steps.  (Okay, enough derivatives--I\'m probably the only one here who gets a sexual thrill out of calculus.)\r\n\r\nCasket Girls is easy: I just have to take the smaller steps first.  I need to strengthen all my creative and directorial muscles enough to allow me to make this project what it needs to be.  There is so much to learn, and so much I need to beef up on.  \r\n\r\nAm I embarrassed by the admission of supposed failure?  Would I be telling you about the process if I was?  THERE IS NO FAILURE IN ADMITTING YOUR LEVEL OF ABILITY.  You are not in a race with everyone else; only with yourself.  I guarantee you that God made some of us much faster runners than others.  It\'s not always about winning the race--it\'s about finishing.  \r\n\r\nCasket Girls is happening, because I have a goal and a plan for making it happen. The finished product may be huge, but I\'ve broken it into component parts and set myself up a program that trains me for my first big project.\r\n\r\n1.  Identification of the goal\r\n\r\n2.  Planning\r\n\r\n3.  Steps to the goal\r\n\r\n4.  Education and training\r\n\r\n5.  More planning with increased knowledge\r\n\r\n6.  Gathering of necessary resource\r\n\r\n7.  More planning with resources on hand\r\n\r\n8.  Execution\r\n\r\n9.  Finish the project within a specified time frame\r\n\r\n10.  Release\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the component steps are broken down through the same process (fractals this time.  Sorry.)  \r\n\r\nThe overall plan is simple:\r\n\r\nFebruary 23: perform cabaret act and get contacts for SF Cabaret\r\n\r\nMay 9: Produce SF Cabaret and raise money for SBB\r\n\r\nJune 6: Start shooting SBB\r\n\r\nAugust 8: Finished with SBB, submit to HUMP! and other festivals\r\n\r\nSeptember 1: Start Catland\r\n\r\nDecember 1: Release Catland\r\n\r\nJanuary 1: Start shooting Casket Girls\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may look like a lot, but it\'s just doing the same exercises over and over again, really.  The difficulty and complexity raises each time, but it\'s slow enough to be manageable.  Marathon runners actually don\'t train by doing the whole 26 miles.  They train by building up to one mile, then five miles, then ten.  They actually don\'t run the 26 until the day of the race, in a lot of cases.  Every little success provides encouragement for the next success.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my list, I will be more proficient in producing, directing, writing, performing, editing, and many technical aspects.  I will have learned how to solve the problems that arise, and I will have ABSOLUTE PROOF that I can reach my goals.\r\n\r\n1. Goal\r\n\r\n2. Planning\r\n\r\n3. Execution\r\n\r\nNever plan for failure; plan for success.  There are no impassable obstacles; only thrilling challenges.  Set realistic goals and go get them!  You need to have self-set goals.  Every success, no matter how small, trains you to succeed.  Success is a learned process.\r\n\r\nNow, if you all will excuse me, I have to go practice shaking my tailfeathers in a fetching enough fashion that I can have an act ready in three weeks.  ','309');

I have a very nice woman in a black car take care of me. It doesn\'t hurt that she just so happens to be an Atomic Bombshell, one of the best troupes in the best burlesque city on the planet.\r\n\r\nI heard my phone hit the pavement as I exited the car. i said to my L.A. Douchebag, \"I just dropped my phone,\" to which he replied, \"BLAAARRGGHH!\" which translates to: \"Oh, I\'m so sorry! Wicked bad energy, yo. Let\'s go find an unsuspecting musician to rape.\"\r\n\r\nI remember thinking at the time, \"That was over three hundred dollars. I should probably pick it up,\" and then thinking, \"BLAAARRGGHH!\" which translates to: \"Oh, to hell with it! I\'m a rich, fat American!

Fine. 99% of the time, that\'s true.\r\n\r\nExcept for one thing: I do not now, nor will I ever, accept public funding for anything I do. That money is earmarked for people who need it; artists whose time has not yet come, those so revolutionary that their genius is only know beginning to be recognized.\r\n\r\nOr, as in the case of The Descendants Project (my top friend), a project that revolutionizes the way we tell something so simple as the story of two friends becoming separated by the Holocaust, sixty years after it happened. For the record, I cry every time I view that film. The way it brings to the forefront of the mind the forgotten eradication of a single individual, a person with a face and a name, with a family, with a home, with a history, with children whose families live on into eternity with the memories of inhuman horrors not seen in the circles of hell . . . It\'s an amazingly powerful piece. It\'s getting funding, and it deserves more. This is why the art of film was invented.\r\n\r\nBitch Kitty Racing? A company which begins the conversation with: \"Fuck you?\" No. That\'s not our goal. Our goal is maintaining our fierce independence and the freedom to do whatever-the-hell we want. Yes, we do have a message. Yes, we do have an Artistic Statement. But it will be a cold day in hell before we take money away from such as The Descendants Project to finance our vision.\r\n\r\nIt goes further still. As you all know, Bitch Kitty Racing is dedicated to giving one half of all proceeds from upcoming film projects back to the community. We are dedicated to fulfilling one of life\'s basic needs; that of food. Food, shelter, clothing, and water can physically sustain a human being. We\'re trying for the first quarter.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes totally kills me that we don\'t just raise it and give it all away. When I spend $200, $500, $1000 on a shoot, I feel guilt and shame. \"This money could do so much more,\" I think to myself. \"$1000 is three hundred meals!\" The truth of the matter is, I have complete faith that I can do so much more. If we consider all this investment expense, I am setting up a company that can earn that $1000 back a thousand times over, and I can give $500,000 towards feeding children in my community, in the community that is my home, surrounded by my neighbors, my friends.\r\n\r\nI still bear the physical marks of childhood poverty, in my spine and in my knees. Being hungry is quite probably the worst humiliation God ever visited on a sapient species. It\'s totally unnecessary.\r\n\r\nSo, excuse me for being an arrogant, egotistical prick when I say this, but I can stop hunger in my community by providing a working example of a company that is both caring and profitable.\r\n\r\nThis is my art. This is what I have chosen. I create a fun product that stretches the limits of creativity, no matter how absurd. People pay for that product. I cover operating and production expenses, support artists in my community, put aside some for the next project, allow myself time to create more product, and give a defined percentage towards creating a better world for all of us.\r\n\r\nI have never been more driven to succeed in my life. What I\'m doing is exactly what I know to be the right thing to do. Every investment I take in now is a loaded shotgun aimed against the inanity of poverty in a wealthy society. All I have to do is what I\'m doing, and I will work harder every day at that as I realize how wonderful it is to live in a world where I can both be an artist (a self-centered, arrogant, egotistical prick) and save some kid from dying in an alley.\r\n\r\ni have never been more proud of Bitch Kitty Racing as I am at this moment.

Now then, to the meat.  Today\'s subject: Caviar and Truffles<br><br>So, today, and I\'m not making this up, for lunch I dined on caviar and truffles.  I am still clapping my hands and turning around in small circles in appreciation of how lucky I am.  Insane, utterly decadent, there are no words for the taste of consuming the ethereal essence of the sea.  Truffles?  Holy crap, the corporeal body surging with immediate pre-release ecstasy.  Oooohhhh, uuunnnhhhh, oooohhhhh . . . .  Oh . . . God!  Oh, GOD!  OH!  OH!  FUCK!!!  OH!!!  UUUUnnnnhhhhh . . .<br><br>Then I had to deal with the rest of my day which, like any good post-hedonistic festival, involved sleeping.  I woke up after a two hour nap (!), and had to go to the bar to earn my daily wage.   I have never felt more like a frustrated Jesus, wanted to lay hands on all and lift them up to the glory that is the simple being of life.  \"It\'s so much more than this!\" I thought.  \"Please, I beg of you, look!  LOOK!\"  <br><br>Apparently, I\'m not the Messiah.  No, the evening progressed with the same old slogging pace with which it always proceeds.  Still, and I mean this honestly, I want to give motivational speeches to everyone who comes in.  \"LOOK!\" I want to say.  \"Look at yourself!  You\'re so talented!  You have so much energy!  Look what your life could be like if you didn\'t sit here eight hours a day!  What do you dream about?  What do you want to do?  It\'s all right there!  Just go take it!  I\'ll help you!\"<br><br>Truffles?  No, a deep-seated desire to uplift.  I know that success and happiness is the responsiblity of the individual, and I understand that the desire to live life as one sees fit is a deep-seated morality, but damn! some days I just want to grab people and shake them senseless!   \"You want something more!\" I\'d yell.  \"You know as well as I do there\'s more than (hand motions  disdainfully indicating the fetid shallowness of the bar) this!\"<br><br>Ah, well . . .  To each his own, I suppose.  Still, it seems like such a God-damned pointless waste of all the potential that lies in humans to wallow in the day-to-day, to worry about the light bill, to mope over bad relationships, to agonize over the future WHEN IT\'S COMPLETELY IN YOUR CONTROL.  <br><br>I swear, in fewer than two weeks I\'m going to be on late night TV pitching a system for achieving personal fulfillment.  <br><br>What do you want?  How can you get it?  Plan it.  Execute that plan.  <br><br>Wow, was that hard?','315');

However, they are making the same point that we made at the Vehicle Research Institute back when I was there: the big business approach to biofuels is actually worse for the world than the big business approach to oil.  \r\n\r\nSo, use your head, know your sources, and remember that there is no quick fix for climate change.  As Ms. Morgenstern says, \"We\'re all gonna fucking die.\"  And, as Mr. Moroney says, \"We\'re all gonna fucking die, and it\'s probably going to be quite painful.\"\r\n\r\nNo, seriously, biofuels are really wonderful at shortening the carbon cycle from 167 million years to one growing season, but growing them is a nightmare.  Ethanol is a fucking joke, nothing more than pork barrel politics.  People need to get re-elected, so they make their constituents rich by jacking up the price of corn, which leads to more corn production, which leads to more land converted from forests and food, to corn farming . . .  You get the idea.  \r\n\r\nBiodiesel.  Biodiesel can be very effective, depending on where it comes from.  There is more energy in diesel than in ethanol.  As fuels go, pound for pound, ethanol has fairly low energy, i.e., it takes more fuel to go the same distance than if you used diesel or gasoline.  \r\n\r\nNatural gas is so cheap it doesn\'t matter, but no one seems to be going in that direction.  Huh, maybe there\'s no money in it.\r\n\r\n<embed src=\"http://www.veoh.com/videodetails2.swf?player=videodetailsembedded&type=v&permalinkId=v6270137DSYehHpS&id=anonymous\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" width=\"540\" height=\"438\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\"></embed>\r\n\r\n			','317');

Over the years, I have heard so many terrible things about myself that I giggle at my own wickedness.  None of the rumors are true, of course.  The things I have done are actually far worse than the things  that I haven\'t done.\r\n\r\nGossips are like mortally wounded kittens, kittens torn open and crazy with pain, covered with their own blood and feces of dying; with their itty little hooked claws of \"Did you hear?\" and their bitty little milk teeth of morally righteous indignation, they are going to do their damnedest to hurt somebody on their way out.  However, the only people they can hurt with their ineffectual little intents are other wounded kittens; lions infrequently notice the attacks of the mewling helpless.\r\n\r\nGossips are those about whom no one would ever gossip.  Why?  They never do anything interesting enough to warrant conversation!  Indeed, if anyone ever mentions their names at all, the sentences are always spoken with slowly shaking heads and tsk-tsks of pity.  We would all like to help the gossip, of course, but what does one do with such a damnably pathetic creature?  Is it better to try to nurse the kitten back to health or simply put it down?  Which is the most humane way of dealing with the so-obviously inhuman?\r\n\r\nThe best defense against gossip is never to engage in it.  During a conversation with you, when someone lowers his voice and says through a conspiratorially lowered chin, \"Did you hear about So-and-so?\" politely say, \"Excuse me,\" and leave the company of this person.  If someone asks you for information on another, say, \"I have So-and-so\'s number right here on my phone.  Let me give it to you so you can get your information from the source.\"  Never divulge anything about another human being; even the most insignificant bit of drunken drivel can be sharpened enough to hurt someone.  (Indeed, oatmeal on it\'s own is perfectly harmless; so is paper.  In prisons, however, they are combined to create a papierâ€“mÃ¢chÃ© stiletto.)\r\n\r\nSo, if you feel the need to talk about me, please, by all means, go ahead.  I like it!
